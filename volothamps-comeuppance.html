<br><br><b>Six of Spades's Guide to the Game of Baldur's Gate</b>
<br><font size=5>(The whole series; from Baldur's Gate I through Throne of Bhaal)<br><br></center>

<font size=3><blockquote>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This website was created for the purpose of helping you, the player, understand and enjoy the Baldur's Gate series.
True, there are already other online sites that achieve much the same purpose as mine, and if you own the game you should also own the manual(s) that came with it. Why,
then, does this site exist? Here's why.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1. The manuals are rather clunky, and if you have both BG1 and BG2 an awful lot of information gets repeated. Some information is even apocryphal, conflicting, or otherwise incorrect.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2. <i>I keep secrets from you,</i> and for your own good. Way back when I was just an innocent newbie, I was reading about the game online when I accidentally stumbled
upon the <u>exact</u> location of the best damn helmet in the entire BG saga. This helmet is the object of a very intense & challenging sidequest, and being able to find and
keep said helmet is meant to be quite an achievement, and something of its own reward. I was denied that experience, forever: That website spoiled the entire quest for me, before
I'd ever had a chance to solve it for myself. That's the main reason why Volothamp's Comeuppance was created: To be a <b>SPOILER-FREE</b> alternative to those other sites out
there. If you want to know in advance exactly what enemies are to be found in each map area, and how much EXP and loot you'll gain for defeating them, and stuff like that,
go and read the walkthroughs on some <i>other</i> site. I treat you like an adult here, I will <i>not</i> hold your hand or spoon-feed you the answers. Other sites were created for people
who want to <u>know</u> the game—I want to help you <u>understand</u> it.<br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This guide is valid for the entire Baldur's Gate saga, but you may find it helpful to know if what you're reading is actually pertinent to (the portion of) the game
that you're currently playing. That's why this site is color-coded:<br>
General data that's valid from <b>BG1</b> (Baldur's Gate I) onward is in <b>black</b>.<br>
Details pertinent only to <b>TotSC</b> (Tales of the Sword Coast, the expansion to BG1) is in <font color=cccc00><b>yellow</b><font color=000000>.<br>
Information that first comes into play in <b>BG2</b> (Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn) is in <font color=007700><b>green</b><font color=000000>.<br>
And stuff that's only important for <b>ToB</b> (Throne of Bhaal, the expansion to BG2) is in <font color=0000ee><b>blue</b><font color=000000>.<br>
<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few rules do change between BG1 & BG2, and even between plain SoA (the acronym for a game of BG2 without ToB) and full BG2 that also has ToB installed. When it's
important, I will specify how the rule has different versions . . . but in general, I assume that if you have BG1 or BG2, you are also playing with their respective expansions installed. I also admit
to a bias in favor of BG2's rules, mainly because more & more games of BG1 are being played on the BG2 engine. This guide is also written to be descriptive of a game of BG that has the appropriate
patches and Fixpacks installed, but does not have any other modifications at all.<a name="contents"><br><br>
<center>Anyway, that's enough blather.

<br><b>Chapter 1: The Spirit of the Game</b><font size=3></center><br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unlike some Role-Playing Games, which are arranged so that the protagonist is always the same
character (with the same name, appearance, abilities, & so on), in Baldur's Gate you build the protagonist from the ground up, with traits that <i>you</i> select. This
facet of the game is probably the #1 contributor to the "replayability" of Baldur's Gate, because gameplay is so different from one type of character to another (a
Fighter is handled nothing like a <font color=007700>Shapeshifter</font> is nothing like a Transmuter is nothing like a Cleric/Thief) that players want to
beat the game over & over with different characters—most even stop playing their first game before they've gotten very far and roll up an entirely new protagonist, not
because they found the game too difficult, but simply because they want to explore what a completely different set of abilities and restrictions feels like.<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The protagonist is frequently referred to as the Main Character or Player Character, or just "PC." The entire rest of the game is
populated <td width=5><td><img src=images/pic43.jpg></table>
with Non-Player Characters, or NPCs. Some of these NPCs are adventurers like yourself, and you can recruit them to join your party to aid you in your various
quests and endeavors. The maximum party size is 6, so you can have no more than 5 other people assisting you at once. Much depends on the type and number of people you
select to accompany you (more people in your group means you can handle large fights more easily, but your character will gain power more rapidly if you travel alone),
as well as the qualities of the individual NPCs: More Warriors means you can handle run-of-the-mill fights more easily, more Priests means the party will be in
generally better health all the time, a party that lacks a Thief could be stopped cold by a locked door, etc. The large variety of recruitable NPCs available to
accompany you is the #2 reason for BG's replayability, because different NPCs have different personalities, different relationships with other party members, and in
BG2, most have their own quests as well. Playing with a different set of NPCs can make it feel like an entirely different game.<br><br>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><a href=images/ankhegbig.jpg><img src=images/tankhegbig.jpg><td width=5><td>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Baldur's Gate, the PC must always be in active play: He (assuming you've made the main character a male) cannot leave the party, and
must be kept alive at all costs, because his survival is critical to the Main Plot, the overarching story arcs of both BG1 and BG2. So the PC must never be allowed to
die—if he <u>does</u> get killed, all gameplay immediately halts, and you must Reload to an earlier point at which you Saved the game. You can Reload at any time, and
for any reason: Because a battle went badly for your side, because you want to find out what would have happened if you'd said <b>this</b> instead of <b>that</b>,
because an innocent bystander got killed in the crossfire, because you just realized that you spent so much money on beer that you can't afford that shiny new helmet,
etc. Being able to Reload is like a free "Go Back</table>
in Time" button, and every time you enter a new map area, the game makes a new Auto-Save for you, so you always have a recent Savepoint to fall back on. This is by far
the most powerful weapon you have in your crusade to beat the game, as it essentially makes it impossible for you to be defeated: If you lose a battle, you can always
go back and try it again, and again, and again, <i>literally</i> as many times as you want, until you beat it or until you decide to leave that fight for later—because
you can almost always come back to it when your characters are stronger and have better equipment. The second most important tool at your disposal is the Space Bar. 
Hitting Space will Pause and un-Pause the game, and gives you complete control: Even in the middle of an extremely frenzied, full-scale battle, you can Pause, scroll
the screen around to take a good long look at everything that's happening all around you, issue detailed commands to each of your party members, and then un-Pause and
watch those commands be carried out.<br><br>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Both BG1 and BG2 are jam-packed with quests for you to go on: Each game has a very strong,
well-written Main Plot that forms the overarching story arc for the whole game, as well as dozens of smaller side-quests . . . although in this case, "smaller" doesn't
always mean small. Sure, some of the sidequests are doltishly simple "take this item across town for me" kinds of errands, but others are major enterprises that involve
long journeys, convoluted intrigue, and/or harrowing combat. Closely tied to the Main Plot is the World Map, which is rather inappropriately named as you can't visit
(or even see) the entire world, just the country that you're in.<br>In BG1, the "World" Map is of a territory known as the Sword Coast, ruled from the walled city of
Baldur's Gate. You start the game with<td width=5><td><a href=images/ship.jpg><img src=images/tship.jpg></table>
a map that is almost completely blank: Only the more well-known towns and villages, and the roads connecting them, are marked down. As you progress, you will explore
more and more new map areas, gradually filling in the entire map. Visiting new lands is almost entirely at your own prerogative, and is entirely optional: If you
followed the Main Plot and nothing <u>but</u> the Main Plot, you would explore no more than 25% of the map. Large sections of territory are plot-related, and will be
completely inaccessible to you until you have reached certain points of the Main Plot.<br>In BG2, you have left the Sword Coast and are now in the nation of Amn
(directly to the south of the Sword Coast), which has the great city of Athkatla as its capital. The map is both more open and more restrictive than BG1: Very little of
the map needs to be "unlocked" by following the Main Plot, but the <i>number</i> of map areas to visit is also sharply diminished from BG1—it has almost none of the
sense of "Let's go explore the wilderness" that BG1 had.<br>Also of note is your Journal, which automatically makes note of anything quest-related, so you can scroll
through it to see if there are any quests that you've started (or been offered) but haven't finished yet. The BG2 Journal is far superior to the BG1 version, because it
has separate sections for "Quests" and "Done Quests," allowing you to easily see what loose ends are still lying around, and also a third section that keeps track of
major events in the Main Plot. In BG2, you can also write in your own Journal, in case you run into something you might want to remember later (like a door you can't
open or an enemy you can't beat . . . yet). The Journal in both games is chapter-specific: If you're in, say, Chapter 4, and you want to see what quests you already
wrapped up in Chapter 2, you can scroll back to Chapter 2 and start reading. In the BG1 Journal, you move between chapters by clicking on the little silver arrowheads,
and in BG2 they're big purple things.<br><br>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><a href=images/chickens.jpg><img src=images/tchickens.jpg><td width=5><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the key
elements of Baldur's Gate is the sheer flexibility it offers: Sure, the Main Plot is always pretty much the same, and you <i>will</i> have to face the Main Bad Guy
eventually, but the gap between rolling up your character and the final encounter is quite a big one . . . and you can fill that gap with just about <i>anything</i> you
want. If you want to rescue princesses, slay evil monsters, and be a mighty hero, yeah, you can do that. If you want to murder people in their sleep, sell folks into
slavery, and destroy entire ecosystems, yeah, you can do that too. Go get drunk and get into bar fights? Spout some insane gibberish with a bunch of crazed lunatics? Run
a theater and put on plays? Pit your combat skills against rabid chickens? Patronize whorehouses? Rob churches? Bust somebody out of jail? Rescue</table>
innocent livestock from certain death? Go shoplifting from various stores and markets? Yeah. You can do that. In fact, there are really only four major things that you
<u>can't</u> do in this game: Swim, ride things (horses, wagons), climb things (trees, walls), and set buildings on fire. But apart from that stuff, you're free to
roleplay pretty much any type of character you want, from Lawful Good Paladin to Neutral Evil <font color=007700>Assassin</font> to Chaotic Neutral
<font color=0000ee>Wild Mage</font>.<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The main thing that I <b>dis</b>like about the BG series is its <i>lack</i> of randomness—an odd trait for the game to have, considering
that it's constantly rolling dice and otherwise generating random numbers that determine the course of the game. But compare Baldur's Gate with related RPGs like Diablo
and Fate: In Diablo, each dungeon level is randomly generated (never the same map twice) and filled with similarly random monsters who, when killed, drop random loot—and
even the properties and enchantments on the magical equipment are set completely by chance. In Baldur's Gate, on the other hand, you can enter Durlag's Tower and 
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>(provided you've been there before) you already <u>know</u> where enemies gather, what types of enemies they are, which ones
drop what specific items, where all the traps are, etc. It's a delicate balance, and though I dislike Baldur's Gate being so predictable, in my view its designers made
the right decision: It allows Baldur's Gate greater degrees of depth and realism. The quests in BG are frequently convoluted and rich in atmosphere; the quests in Diablo
and Fate are mostly very basic "Go kill creature X, and/or bring Item Y back to me." The loot in Baldur's Gate is exactly what the enemy actually uses: If you're
fighting a guy wearing enchanted Splint mail and swinging a really cool magical Halberd, when you kill him you will get <i>that</i> armor and <i>that</i> Halberd. In
Diablo, you can kill some tiny little bat-thing, and watch it suddenly drop a huge set of Full Plate armor—in precisely what pocket was it carrying <u>that</u>? So I
prefer BG's method of handling probabilities . . . even though it's not perfect, and the amount of truly <i>random</i> loot is a mere pittance compared with what enemies
<i>always</i> drop, I find the in-depth and realistic world of Baldur's Gate vastly preferable to the random dungeons of Diablo and Fate.<td width=5><td>
<img src=images/pic04.jpg></table><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So yes, there are a few things that I don't like about the BG series. There are things that other people don't like, too. Which brings us
to the #3, and perhaps the most important, reason why Baldur's Gate is still being played, more than 10 years after it first came out: <i>Those negative traits can be
changed</i>. The construction of the game was such that it is possible to open up the files that the game engine uses, and change them, remove them, add new ones . . . 
making very real changes in gameplay. These modifications can also be put online, for other people to download and install on their own computers, so that players
around the would could be using new items, new spells, new quests, new recruitable NPCs, new map areas . . . all produced by fellow players, for free, simply for
everyone's mutual enjoyment of the game. There are literally hundreds of modifications, or "mods," from dozens of modders, and translated into several languages. There
are also several online BG communities, both for simply playing the game and for modding it—the latter is getting more and more prevalent, as making the mods isn't
terribly difficult, and even those who don't make mods themselves can offer feedback and make suggestions. Despite having been commercially "dead" for quite some time, the
game itself is still around, and still evolving—even when you think you've seen it all, somebody else comes around the corner with an entirely new wrinkle.<br><br><hr><br>
<b>Q: You don't seem to be mentioning the game of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance at all. Isn't it part of the same series?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: Hell no.</b> BG: Dark Alliance does in fact start off in the city of Baldur's Gate, and you do play a sword-&-sorcery adventurer who goes
on quests and kills monsters and stuff . . . but the similarities pretty much end there. The two sets of games were made and released by entirely different companies, and
gameplay is wholly different: While the genuine BG games allow you full control over Character Creation, with literally <i>millions</i> of possible results, and you pick a
party of up to 5 other NPCs to aid you in your journey, BG:DA lets you choose between a whopping <b>three</b> pre-made characters to play, and you're all alone. I'm not
even sure it's based on D&D rules. BG:DA is, essentially, Gauntlet by another name, they simply called it Baldur's Gate to cash in on BioWare's success, and to confuse
people into thinking that their game was actually good.<br><br>

<b>Chapter 2: A Glossary of technical terms to know</b><font size=3></center><br><br>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>Here are the definitions / explanations of some commonly-used terms used to describe aspects of the game; both within the game itself and by people talking about the game.<font size=5><br><br><hr><br></font size=3>
<b>Armor Class:</b> This number indicates how difficult it will be to hit a character with a physical attack, such as a sword thrust or crossbow bolt. Counterintuitively, in BG a <i><u>low</u></i> Armor Class is <i><u>good</u></i>óthe lower your AC, the less
likely you are to get hit. All creatures have an Armor Class; animals and the like have an AC determined by such factors as their size, the<td width=10><td><img src=images/wordcloud.jpg></table>
toughness of their skin, and how quickly they can dodge. For Humans and other adventuring types, your base AC is 10, and putting on armor changes your base AC to the base AC of the armor: For Leather Armor (the weakest), that AC is 8, and for Full Plate
(the strongest) it's 1. Regardless of what armor you have on (or even none at all), the game then applies any AC bonuses or penalties caused by having a high or low Dexterity score. Also of great importance to your AC are your AC Modifiers, which show how
effective your armor is at stopping various types of damage. All weapons do one of the following types of damage: Blunt, Piercing, Slashing, and Missile. All armors have AC Modifiers that make them more effective against certain types of damage, and less 
effective against othersófor example, Chain Mail is very good at deflecting Slashing attacks, but is lousy at absorbing the impact of Blunt damage. (Which, not coincidentally, closely mirrors how chain mail performs in real life.) See THAC0.<br><br>

<b>Attacks per Round:</b> Your ApR is one of your most important combat stats: How rapidly you can attack. All characters have a base ApR of 1, and this is modified by the traits of certain items (for instance, all Shortbows and Longbows grant +1 ApR while
in use), and if you're a Warrior, by your experience level and your proficiency with the weapon you're using. All Warriors gain +1/2 ApR at Level 7, and another 1/2 at Level 13. Characters who do not have any levels in a Warrior class will <u>not</u> gain
ApR from their levels, or from putting extra proficiency points into a selected weapon type. Whatever ApR they may actually have, all characters will <i>appear</i> to attack multiple times per round, especially when in melee combat. This is done for
aesthetic reasons: If your Cleric swung his Warhammer once, and then just <i>stood there</i> for 5 seconds before making his next attack, he'd look pretty stupid. In-game, ApR is expressed as a proper fraction: If your character has an ApR of 2.5, his
Records screen will display this as "5/2." Also, you don't actually make a <u>half</u>-attack; In this case, you would make 3 attacks in one round and 2 attacks in the next, and keep alternating, so it averages out to 2.5 attacks per round.<br><br>

<b>Area of Effect:</b> A large percentage of spells and spell-like abilities have the potential to affect more than one target, depending on the specific spell and where creatures are standing relative to the actual target of the spell. If somebody aims a
Fireball at your Tank, and you are within 30 feet of your Tank at the moment that the spell hits, you are in that Fireball's Area of Effect, or AoE, and you will get burned.<br><br>

<b>Avatar / Paperdoll:</b> These are terms that describe a character's appearance in the game. Your avatar is your sprite-set, the set of animations that show you walking, fighting, just standing around, etc. The little figure in the Inventory screen is your
paperdoll, so called because by equipping different weapons and armor, you're essentially playing dress-up. There are dozens of avatars, because every creature in the game needs to have an avatar, or you wouldn't be able to see it. But only a few of these
avatars have paperdolls associated with them: There are paperdolls for Male Halfling Cleric, Female Elven Fighter, Male Half-Orc Thief, etc., because those are all perfectly valid character builds, and you need to see what you look like in the Inventory
screen. But the vast majority of avatars, like Hobgoblin, do not have paperdolls because there's no valid in-game way of making yourself look like a Hobgoblin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The other definition of "Avatar" is its in-game meaning: The various gods and assorted deities of the Forgotten Realms pantheons each have their own Avatar, the physical shape in which they choose to manifest themselves before
mortals. (Many gods have multiple avatars, actually.) Avatars can be attacked (although that's almost always a <i>reeeeally</i> bad idea), but even if one is defeated, the god will not die, he will simply lose his grip on the Prime Material plane and be
forced to return to his home plane, where he rests and heals until he's willing to visit the Prime again. One of the perks of being a god.<br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic45.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>
<b>Backstab:</b> A vicious, highly effective attack that only Thieves (and <font color=007700>Stalkers</font>) can do: While in Stealth, you must sneak up on an enemy, and attack with any melee weapon that a true-class Thief can use. If you
succeed in hitting the target, your damage is rolled normally, and then multiplied by your Backstab Multiplier, which increases with your EXP level. Note that just because you can <i>use</i> a weapon does not mean that you can </i>Backstab</i> with it. For
instance, Fighter/Thieves can use Maces and 2-Handed Swords, but because straight Thieves cannot use those types of weapons, any Backstab you attempt to make with them will failóthe damage will not be multiplied. Some types of creatures are immune to
Backstab, for reasons such as being so watchful that you can't sneak up on them, or they don't have any especially vulnerable areas to target, or sometimes just because the designers of the game (whether we're talking about BG or PnP) say so.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One important quirk of the game engine is that, in order to Backstab, you have to get <u>behind</u> your enemy before you attack. You don't have to be <i>directly</i> behind them, there's a fairly broad arc of positions where
you can stand. When the enemy wants to Backstab <b>you,</b></table>however, it does not have this requirement: A Stealthed or Invisible foe can Backstab you right in the face, if that happens to be the direction you're looking.<br><br>

<b>Bard Song:</b> A skill unique to Bards, and their signature ability: They have the option to stop fighting, and instead sing and play music to lift the spirits of their comrades and dishearten their enemies. Bards may walk around while singing, but cannot
do anything else. Pureclass Bards and all Bard kits each have a different Song with different effectsóusually affecting all allies within 30 feet of the Singing Bard. Also known as Battlesong, it may be used an infinite number of times per day, for as long
as the Bard wishes.<br><br>

<b>BioWare:</b> The corporation that made the Baldur's Gate series. The company known as Black Isle (a division of Interplay) was also involved, but relatively loosely: The game's Credits list Black Isle employees as being responsible for such things as
Testing, Quality Assurance, and Marketing, while BioWare gets the credit for the <i>real</i> work, things like Writing, Programming, and Core Game Design.<br><br>

<b>Breath Weapon:</b> A specific type of special ability that involves using magical means to change the nature of one's exhaled breath, with the most well-known example being fire-breathing dragons.<br><br>

<b>Casting Time:</b> All spells require a certain amount of time to cast; 9 means it takes almost an entire round, 1 means it casts almost instantly. Lower is better not only because the spell takes effect sooner, but because it reduces the amount of time
during which you are vulnerable to getting your spell disrupted by an attack.<br><br>

<b>Critical Hit / Critical Miss:</b> When you make an attack on a creature, the game rolls a D20 to see if you hit it. Regardless of THAC0 and AC, a die roll of 20 <i>always</i> hits, and a die roll of 1 <i>always</i> misses. Any Critical Hit (or "natural
20") means that the damage dealt by that hit is doubled, unless the target is wearing a helmet (or is otherwise immune to Critical Hits). Critical Misses also affect combat: If you're unlucky enough to roll a 1, the game imposes a slight delay before you
can attack again, with the rationale being that you lost your balance and had to get back up, or something like that. Also, if you're in Stealth and you roll a Critical Miss, you immediately become visible, because you tripped or hiccupped or something.

<br><br><b>CHARNAME:</b> This is another name for the main character, originally used in modding circles because "< CHARNAME >" is a dialog token used by the game, as a string reference to whatever name that the player chose for the main character during
Character Creation. "Player1" is also sometimes used, but this is a script reference, not a dialog token.<br><br>

<b>Cutscene:</b> A couple of times in BG1, and more often in BG2, the game uses cutscenes to show action: Your user-interface disappears, and the screen shows characters (sometimes including your own party members) moving and interacting without any input
from youóyou are essentially just watching a movie of what's going on.<br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><b>Detect/Disarm Traps:</b> Also called Find Traps, this is arguably the most vital skill a Thief can learn. Pressing the "Find Traps" button puts you in Detect mode, where you will remain until you perform any
action other than walking around. Each round you are Detecting, the game rolls a D100 and compares the roll with your D/D skill: If your skill is higher and an enemy-laid Trap is nearby, it will appear. Once the Trap has been spotted, you can use your
Thieving button to click on it, and the game will compare your D/D skill with the Trap's "baseline" difficulty: Again, if your skill is higher, you will successfully<td width=5><td><img src=images/thescene.jpg alt="Art by Mephibosheth">
</table> deactivate the Trap (and if you're in BG2, you'll get some EXP). If your Disarm skill is lower, however, your attempt will failóusually nothing will happen (and you can try again & again), but sometimes the Trap can go off in your face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is no point in investing more than 100% skill in Find Traps, and even 80% is enough to remove almost all Traps. A few Traps, however, <u>cannot</u> be disarmed, and some very rare ones cannot even be detected at all.
Detect mode will also discover secret doors (all characters can do this, using Detect mode just works better) and reveal illusionsósee Detect Illusions. A Thief's Detect/Disarm Traps ability can be approximated by having a Monk in the party, using your
<font color=007700>Familiar</font> (depending on which Familiar you have, if you have one at all), and the Priest spell of Find Traps.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp BG1 states that the success of disarming a Trap depends on one's Pick Locks score; this is incorrect. As I said, Detect Traps is the only skill used.<br><br>

<b>Detect Illusions:</b> Although far less important than skills like Find Traps and Pick Locks, it's still pretty useful: When the Thief is paying close attention to his surroundings (the Find Traps ability is turned on), each round the game will roll a
D100 and compare the result with his Detect Illusions score, allowing the Thief to potentially see through all harmful (cast by an enemy) Illusionary magics in the immediate areaóit seems to work best if the Thief is within 15 feet or so of the enemy, but
the range might be greater than that, I'm not too sure. There is no point in going higher than 100% in Detect Illusions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Detect Illusions ability can be approximated through the use of spells, as both Priests and Wizards have access to spells like Detect Invisibility, Oracle, and True Seeing. All of these spells are from the Divination school,
however, so an enemy Wizard under Spell Immunity: Divination will be protected from all of themóbut the Detect Illusions ability cannot be blocked by any means.<br><br>

<b>Dice:</b> The PnP game of Dungeons & Dragons places heavy use on many-sided dice, and Baldur's Gate works the same wayóit just uses a random-number generator that <i>mimics</i> the results of throwing said dice. These dice come in many shapes, defined by
their number of sides: There's the D2 (a coin), D3 (a cube that has the numbers 1, 2, and 3 each written on opposing faces of the die), D4, D6 (a common 6-sided die), D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100 (a big, round sucker, but a lot of people just roll a pair of
D10s instead). Throughout the game, and this website, you'll see notation such as 1D10, 4D6, 2D4+5, etc. These stand for, respectively, "The result of 1 10-sided die," "The sum of four 6-sided dice," and "The sum of two 4-sided dice, with 5 added to the total."

<br><br><b>Experience Points:</b> EXP is extremely important to every character, as it is the means by which a character gains experience levels, the predominant indicator of a character's power. Every time you accumulate enough EXP to advance to the next
experience level, you Level Upómeaning you get more hitpoints, weapon proficiency points, spellslots, and Thieving skills, better THAC0 and Saving Throws, and maybe access to a new level of spells. So if you're Level 1 with 0 EXP, you're a wimpy little nothing,
but if you collect enough EXP, you're an epic figure to shake the heavens and trouble the counsels of the mighty. There are two basic "kinds" of EXP: The first is regular EXP, gained by killing enemies and completing quests, and in BG2 your Thief also wins EXP
for picking locks and disarming traps, and your Mage collects it for successfully scribing new spells into his spellbook. All EXP gained by any of these methods is automatically divided by the number of people you have in the party, and shared equally among
them, regardless of who "earned" it by killing the monster or scribing the spell. So a protagonist who runs a Solo game, facing all challenges alone without any other party members to help, will gain levels much faster than a PC who always travels with a full
party of six. The other kind of EXP is Quest Experience, which only occurs in BG2: At certain points in the game, usually major plot events, the game will award Quest EXP to every member of the partyóand each character always gains the same amount, regardless
of how many other people are in the group.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Notes: In BG1, if you manage to kill something while it is not hostile to you, the party only earns 10% of the creature's full EXP value. Every time the party gains EXP, if the number of gained points is not equally divisible by
the number of people in your party, the remainder goes to the people at the head of the party. Example: You have a party of 6, and you kill a monster worth 100 EXP. 100 divided by 6 = 16, leaving a remainder of 4. So the four party members whose portraits are
the highest on the right-hand side of the screen all earn 17 experience points, while the other two get 16 EXP. So the characters who are higher in the "marching order" get a little bit more EXP than the others.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A closely-related matter is the EXP Cap, a ceiling that prevents characters from advancing beyond a certain point. This one done partly to keep the game challenging, but mostly so BioWare wouldn't have to worry about characters
reaching certain levels. For example, if the EXP cap in BG1 allowed Mages to get to Level 12, they would have had to make a whole bunch of Level 6 Wizard spells, and incorporate them into the game. So the caps exist, and they are as follows: BG1 (plain): Each
character can attain no more than 89,000 EXP. BG1 with TotSC installed: All party members stop at 161,000. In BG2:SoA, the cap is at 2,950,000. And BG2:ToB lets you go all the way up to 8,000,000 EXP. Experience awarded to a character who is already at the EXP
Cap does not "trickle down" to other party members who can still benefit from it, it just vanishes into thin air.<br><br>

<b>Faerun:</b> The Sword Coast and Amn are both situated on the western edge of the continent of Faerun, which is the predominant landmass on the world commonly known as Toril, although its full name is Abeir-Toril. Just about every place you can visitóor even
hear aboutóin the BG saga is in Faerun. Another area of note is the continent of Kara-Tur, separated from Faerun by a desert, a couple of mountain ranges, and a huge stone wall. The people, culture, and religions of Kara-Tur roughly correspond to medieval
China/Japan. There is also the newly-discovered continent of Maztica, a region that parallels pre-Columbian Central America.<br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic02.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=5><td><b>Fallen:</b> This adjective has two different, though related, meanings. The most dramatic is that of a being that used to be very much of Good
alignment but has had a crisis of faith or sanity, and is now wholly Evil. The meaning that has a greater bearing on the game, however, affects only Paladins and Rangers. These classes are required to be of Good alignment, and if they behave in a manner that
displeases their respective godsó<i>i.e.</i>, they do Evil thingsóthose gods will strip them of their power. For instance, if you are playing a Ranger, and the party's Reputation falls below 4, you immediately become a Fallen Ranger, which is essentially a
weakened Fighter. You lose all the benefits of your Ranger class (or kit, if you had any), such as the ability to Stealth and cast spells. The drawbacks, however, such as the slow rate of gaining EXP levels and being able to put only 2 stars into any weapon
proficiency, are all retained. <i><b>This condition is permanent.</b></i> The gods are even more strict with their Paladins, who will Fall if their Reputation falls below 6. Note that only PC Paladins and Rangers can Fall: You can take an NPC Paladin into your
party and drive the party's Rep right into the ground, and that Paladin will not Fall.</table><br>

<b><font color=007700>Familiar:</font></b> If you're playing a Wizard or Bard in BG2, you can cast Find Familiar, which summons a small creature to be your companion. Only the PC can cast this spellóeven if other party members learn it, they can't
cast it. Your Familiar is completely under your control, and can fight, cast a couple of low-level spells, and use a couple of Thieving skills . . . and if you're smart, you will never use it to do any of those things, because you're going to keep it safely in
your backpack for the entire game. BioWare saw fit to make all the Familiars so weak and frail that to expose them to any kind of combat situation would be very risky, so the only reason to use the spell at all is for the hitpoint gain: Upon casting FF, your
maximum hitpoints increase by an amount equal to 1/2 of the Familiar's max hitpoints. If the Familiar should die, however, your max hp drops right back down again, you take damage equal to half your Familiar's max hp, and you permanently lose one point of
Constitution. You can cast FF again to replace a slain Familiar, but you can't have more than one at a time.<br><br>

<b>Fatigue:</b> Any party member who's been awake for a long time will become Fatigued, which imposes penalties to Thieving skills and attack rolls when in combat: You can still hit your opponents, but the game won't let you roll Critical Hits anymore. If you
keep the party going and going for long periods of time, these penalties continue to increase, but go right back to normal as soon as you Rest. Fatigue is much more of a problem in BG1 than BG2: In BG1, everyone gets tired at about the same time (usually around
the 24-hour mark), the wilderness maps are much further apart and there are many more of them (meaning, as soon as you enter a new map area, the whole party gets Fatigued, so you're fighting at a disadvantage more than half the time), and the Fatigue penalties
make much more of a difference when you're low-level. In BG2, the amount of time a character can go without getting Fatigued depends largely on their Constitution.<br><br>

<b>Hardcoded:</b> This is a modding term, and refers to aspects of the game that are written directly into Baldur.exe and therefore cannot be altered simply by editing a few files. For all intents and purposes, anything that is hardcoded <b><u>cannot</u></b> be
changedówhile this is not strictly true, it should be accepted <i>as</i> true by anyone who is not already very familiar with the intricacies of modding.<br><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><br>

<b><font color=007700>Hide in Shadows:</font></b> See Stealth.<br><br>

<b>Hitpoints:</b> As this is the most fundamental stat, not only in the game, or even in the entire genre, but across <i>multiple</i> game genres, I really don't think I need to explain this to you. But just in case you know it only by another name: Hitpoints
are your health, the amount of damage you can takeóif you hit 0 hp, you're dead. Creatures killed by very powerful (physical) blows that drag their hitpoints well into the negative range will visibly explode in a spray of meat and bloodóthis is called
"chunking," and happens because the killing stroke was so powerful that it essentially dismembered them. (You can disable this in the Options menu, by turning off Gore.) Creatures (including party members) that get chunked cannot be Resurrected, because their
bodies are too badly damaged.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic26.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table><br>

<b><font color=0000ee>HLAs:</font></b> Characters who attain "epic" levels in ToB will gain a new High-Level Ability each time they Level Up. Some of these HLAs are new and powerful spells, while others are very potent Special Abilities. Each class, class
combination, and (to some degree) kit has a different HLA pool to choose from. Most of the Ability HLAs can be chosen again & again, allowing you to use that ability an additional 1x/day each time you choose it. Spell HLAs, however, can only be chosen once, as
choosing the ability adds it to your available spells: Wizard HLA spells get added to the Level 9 page in your spellbook, Priest HLA spells appear on the Level 7 section on your Priest Scroll. These spells break a couple of rulesónamely, they act as Level 10
spells even though Mystra herself ruled that no spell above Level 9 could exist, and the Wizard spells are "schoolless" in that they can all be learned by <b>any</b> school of Specialist Mage. HLAs are gained each time you Level Up, provided that the class(es)
<i>in which you are currently gaining levels</i> have a combined total of at least 3,000,000 EXP. To be specific:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you're playing a single-classed character, every time you hit a new level after passing 3 million EXP, you get a new HLA.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you're Multi-classed, you start getting HLAs once your classes' <u>combined</u> EXP total exceeds 3 million. At each Level Up, you get to choose from all the HLAs open to you, regardless of which class gained the levelómeaning a
Fighter/Thief can Level up as a Thief, and choose an HLA from the Fighter pool. Cleric/Rangers actually get their first HLA a couple of levels too early, but they miss out on a couple later onóthis is a bug, but at least it evens out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your character is Dual-classed, you get an HLA if your <u>active</u> class is over 3 million EXP. You can take a Fighter up to Level 20, choose 1 HLA and Dual to Mage, and then you're not going to see any more HLAs until you hit
Mage Level 18. You can only access the HLA pool of your active class: Your first HLA came from the Fighter pool, and once you start getting HLAs again they will all be from the Mage pool, because you are no longer gaining levels as a Fighter.<br><br>

<b>Hostile:</b> You and your party are shown with green circles around your feet: You are Allied creatures. In any combat engagement, your opponent(s) are shown with red circles: They are Hostile creatures. Innocents and other creatures not on either side of the
conflict will have light-blue circles: They are Neutral. There are also less common distinctions of a creature's Enemy/Ally status, like "GoodButBlue" (fighting for your side, even though you aren't directing their actions) and "Purple-Circled" (completely
immobile and not under anyone's control, not even their own), but these are rather less important.<br><br>

<b>Gaze Attack:</b> A specific type of special ability that requires no more than being able able to meet (and sometimes hold) another person's eyes, with the most well-known example being a Gorgon's ability to turn you to stone merely by looking directly at
you.<br><br>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic17.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>
<b>Level:</b> Because AD&D isn't confusing enough, we had to place heavy emphasis on a word with at least <b>five</b> separate definitions. When "level" is used by itself, it most commonly means a character's <u>Experience Level</u>, which is displayed on their
Records screen. (A creature's "Hit Dice," or HD, is a synonym for this.) There are also <u>Spell Levels</u>, going from Levels 1 through 7 for Priests, and 1 through 9 for Wizards. When talking about casting spells, there is also the <u>Casting Level</u> to be
consideredóthis is usually, but not always, the same as their Experience Level (<font color=007700>Inquisitors</font> throw Dispel Magic at inflated casting levels, and almost all casting levels are capped at 20). Clerics and Paladins also have <u>
Turn Undead Level</u>sósee Turn Undead. Finally, when a dungeon or tower is arranged with multiple floors stacked one on top of another, those floors are usually referred to as, yeah, levels.<br><br>

<font color=007700><b>Level Drain:</b></font> An effect that, while it does pose actual danger, is most notable for being extremely annoying. Level Drain is a fairly common</table>effect that is inflicted by the melee attacks of certain creatures, usually
Undead. Some creatures are able to inflict Level Drain from a distance, but these are rare, they don't do it often, and it will usually wear off with the passage of time. When you are hit with an attack or spell that causes Level Drain, you will see a message 
that reads anywhere from "One Level Drained" to "Five Levels Drained," depending on the power of the creature who hit you. Let's say you're a Level 14 Fighter, and 2 levels were drained from you. You are now a Level 12 Fighter, and your THAC0, Saving Throws,
and hitpoints have been weakened accordingly. If you were a Thief, your Thieving skills would also be penalized, and if you were a spellcasting class, you would lose the extra spellslots you had gained at Levels 13 & 14. If you get Level Drained again & again,
you could wind up at Level 0, which is automatic death. (Multiclass characters need to to be at Level 0 in both/all of their classes in order to die of Level Drain.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Level Drained character can still earn EXP, but he cannot benefit from it: The game remembers how much EXP you had originally, and it keeps track of how much you earn while you're Level Drained, but it won't let you see it, or
Level Up. In most cases, Level Drain is permanentóthe only way to undo it is by recieving a Restoration spell, which brings back the stolen levels: You're back to being a Level 14 Fighter, and your THAC0, Saving Throws, hitpoints, Thieving skills, and
spellslots are all completely back to normal. (You'll have to Rest again to re-memorize the spells you had in those slots, though.) Restoration also lets you access the EXP you earned while you were Level Drainedóit is possible to get Restored, and immediately
Level Up. The downside of Restoration is that it causes the person who cast it, and/or the person who recieved it, to automatically become very Fatigued. This can be a real pain in the ass, having to listen to one of your party members whine about being tired
every minute or so.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In TotSC, there is one enemy who can Energy Drain you. This is not true Level Drain, all that can happen is a couple of your stats go down by a couple of points, an effect that wears off after a few rounds. Any creature will die,
however, if any of their stats reaches 0.<br><br>

<b>Lore:</b> Every party member has a Lore score, which is a function of their class and level, with modifiers from their Intelligence and Wisdom on top of that. Bards have the highest Lore, with 10 points per level. Mages and Thieves get 3 per level, and
everyone else (including Sorcerers) gets 1 per level. Multi- and Dual-classed characters use whichever of their classes has the higher Lore. What Lore does is save you from having to actually Identify unidentified items: Instead of taking the item to a
Store/Temple or using a spell yourself, just pass it to whoever has the highest Lore. If their Lore score is at least equal to the Lore requirement on the item, they will automatically ID it. In general, the Lore required to identify an item increases with the
strength of the item's enchantment(s), as well as the monetary value of the base item. For example, anyone with at least 20 Lore can ID an Arrow+1, but a 2-Handed Sword+1 (the exact same enchantment) requires 40 Lore.<br><br>

<b>Metagaming:</b> This is the practice of playing a role-playing game from the point of view of the <i>player</i>, rather than the <i>character</i>. The player knows exactly where to obtain the +20 Sword of Cutchamuch, but the character might not even have
the slightest idea that such a weapon even exists. The player knows that in a minute, a group of dangerous enemies is going to suddenly appear out of nowhere, while the character presently has no reason to suspect anything out of the ordinary. Etc. Also known
as "out-of-game knowledge" and "Reload knowledge," this is a rather relative termónearly everybody does it to at least some extent, by doing things like making early trips to the specific maps where they know they'll find the recruitable NPCs they want to have
in the party, or letting the Main Plot wait for a bit while the party does a few sidequests and gains a level or two. It's up to the individual players to decide how much metagaming they're comfortable with.<br><br>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
<b>Mod:</b> Short for "modification," a third-party change or addition to an existing program. There are hundreds of mods written for the Baldur's Gate games, with the majority affecting BG2. While technically illegal (The EULA states, in part, <i>"You may not
decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble the Software, except as permitted by law"</i>), nobody gives a crap: BioWare stopped making any money off of BG several years ago, if anything we're acting as free advertising for them. I don't think there's ever been
any official action against a Baldur's Gate mod, in fact several of the original authors/coders have written with positive feedback, support, and information, and even been major mod contributors in their own right. If you're concerned about the legality of
modding, you'd better close this browser window right now, because <i>"The Software, including, without limitation, all characters, images, sounds, text, screens, game play, derivative works and all other elements of the Software may not be copied, resold,
distributed (electronically or otherwise) . . ."</i> so yeahóif you tell your friend that Baldur's Gate is a fun game, you'll have violated the End-User License Agreement. Pretty scary.<td width=10><td>

<b>Morale:</b> This is a measure of how brave/confident a creature is feeling. Normally, all creatures feel pretty good about themselves, although certain things can cause their morale to fail: If they suddenly lose a large percentage of their hitpoints from a
number of hits in rapid succession, if they see multiple allies being killed right in front of them, or if they are affected by a spell that induces Fear (such as Horror). A Morale Failure may take any of three forms: Running (the creature does nothing but try
to run as far away from combat as possible), Berserk (the creature freaks out and attacks any & all targets that come near it), and Panic (the creature erratically attacks others, runs in some arbitrary direction, or stands around not knowing what to do). All
creatures under Morale Failure are completely uncontrollable until they gradually calm back down.<br><br>

<b><font color=007700>Move Silently:</font></b> See Stealth.<br><br>

<b>Movement Rate:</b> How fast a creature is able to move across open ground. The normal Movement Rate is 6, although this can be changed through means like Haste and Slow spells, and being Encumbered. Certain character clases/kits have altered Movement Rates,
and changes to walking speed can be conferred by some avatar animations as well.<br><br>

<b>Opcode:</b> A modding term, opcodes are a major part of items and especially spells. For example, a suit of Plate Mail armor has multiple Equipping Effects: One iteration of Opcode 0 to set the wearer's base AC, another Opcode 0 to apply Plate's AC Modifier
against Slashing weapons, three instances of Opcode 7 to describe what colors the armor is, two cases of Opcode 144 to grey-out the wearer's Stealth and Thieving buttons (if the wearer has them), and a call to Opcode 145 to block the wearer's ability to cast
Wizard spells while the armor is worn. There are over 300 opcodes, most of which accept parameters to further customize their use (<i>e.g.</i>, how much Acid damage is added to the weapon's impact, how long the creature remains Stunned, etc.).<br><br>

<b>Pick Locks:</b> This fairly self-explanatory skill is extremely useful in the game, as a good number of doors and almost all chests & similar containers are locked. Just use your Thieving button to click on the locked item, and the game will compare your
Open Locks score, plus or minus a random modifier, with the difficulty rating of the lock. Don't count on the randomness factor to be any real help: It's so small that really its only function seems to be to ensure that, frequently, you can't open a lock on the
first try. Your chance of success depends almost entirely on your Open Locks scoreóif you fail 10 times in a row, give up. 75% in Pick Locks is enough to open most things, and with 100% you're guaranteed to get them all on the first attempt. The Pick Locks
skill can be approximated with the Knock spell,<br><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td> or by having your strongest party member try to simply bash all locks open by force.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some locks cannot be picked: In BG1, this is usually the result of a bug, where the difficulty of the lock was accidentally set to an invalid number. In BG2, however, it almost always just means that the door/container is part of a
quest, and you need to find a specific key, or fulfil some other requirement, before it can be unlocked.<br><br>

<b>Pick Pockets:</b> Just what it says. Any person or creature that is not hostile to you can be pickpocketed, by using your Thieving button to click on them: The game takes <i>your</i> Pick Pockets score, subtracts your <i>target's</i> Pick Pocket's score, and
then compares the result with a D100. If the calculation beat the roll, the attempt was successful and you relieve the target of an item they're carrying. If not, you get caught red-handed trying to rob somebody, and they (and any bystanders) will turn Hostile
to you, because, in this game, the punishment for petty thievery is death.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic25.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table>
You can also Critically Fumble stealing something: No matter <u>how</u> high you've cranked your Pick Pockets skill, there is always at least a 1% chance of failure. Whether or not an item can be pickpocketed is determined by where on the target's person it is:
You can steal out of their Backpack, their Quick Items, their Quiver, their Necklaces and even Rings, and any Quick Weapons that they are not actually holding in their hands. (Certain specific items are also flagged as being "Pickpocket-proof.") This can, in
some circumstances, cause the game to crash, at least in BG1: If a creature's combat script tells him to switch to a weapon that he doesn't have anymore (because you stole it), the whole program comes to a screeching halt. This is, however, extremely rare.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Pick Pockets skill is also used for shoplifting: Some stores (usually those that sell very important/valuable items) have security people and other antitheft precautions, but at other stores, it is possible to shoplift: Thieves
and Bards have access to a "Steal" screen that shows all the items in that store's inventory, and you can choose what you want to try to slip under your cloak. Items are shoplifted one at a time, and on each attempt the game rolls your Pickpocket score against
the store's Shoplifting difficultyóthere is no chance of a Critical Fail when stealing from a store, but if you get caught, naturally the shopkeeper goes Hostile and will never sell to you again. If you succeed, the item is transferred to your Inventory, but
with its "Stolen" flag set. Most stores will not purchase items that have been shoplifted, even if there's no way they could possibly know: You can steal a completely nondescript, unenchanted Longsword, take it to a store at the other end of the country, and
they will recognize the sword and know that it's stolen merchandise.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Thief's Pick Pockets skill can be approximated by using a Bard, or your <font color=007700>Familiar</font> if it is sufficiently skilled in that area.<br><br>

<b>Plane:</b> The universe presented in-game (and in the AD&D setting of the Forgotten Realms, where the BG saga is set) is broken up into many distinct layers of reality called Planes. The central and probably largest one is the Prime Material Plane, which
contains the planet of Abeir-Toril and its various landmasses, the sun & moon, and I assume there are a fair quantity of stars as well. The Prime Material contains aspects of just about every other plane of existence, of which there are hundreds: The most basic
are the major ones like the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water, the Positive and Negative Energy Planes, there is a Plane of Shadow, etc. Very powerful beings can create new planes, and in fact many gods have "home planes" custom-built for the
purpose. Planes can be any size and shape (some are barely any larger than their sole resident), and under certain conditions can exhibit certain "warpings" of the rules that bind other planes, such as the laws of physics, magic, and time. Upon their deaths, all
mortal residents of the Prime Material leave that plane and find themselves in one of the "Outlands" planes that make up the afterlifeóthough not all residents of these planes are dead. Apart from death, the only way to move from one plane to another is by
planar travel, which usually takes the form of portals or Spelljammer ships.<br><br>

<b>PnP:</b> Baldur's Gate is the computer version of the rules of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons; PnP is the acronym for "Pencil & Paper," the old-school, analog method. This term mostly crops up in modding circles, in a discussion of a particular item or spell,
when somebody asks or explains how the thing works in the PnP canon lore set down in the D&D sourcebooks. There are some differences between BG & PnP (for instance, the PnP city of Esmeltaran is called "Trademeet" in the game), but these are rather minimal.<br><br>

<b><font color=007700>Psionics:</font></b> Powers of sheer mental energy, these can take many formsósome are relatively familiar, such as mind control and mind-reading, while some seem very strange because they affect physical reality, doing actual
damage to creatures or even throwing them across a room. These powers are most frequently displayed by <font color=007700>Illithids</font>, but other races can learn to employ them as well. Psionics are not a form of magic, and therefore are not
stopped by Magic Resistanceóthey frequently allow victims a Saving Throw to escape their effects, however.<br><br>

<b>Random Encounter:</b> When traveling from one map area to another, there is a chance that you will run into some local wildlife or other creatures:<br><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>The meeting could be one group's attempt to ambush the other, or
merely by sheer accident. In any case, combat almost invariably results, unless the encounter is with fairly placid creatures such as Bears. All random encounters take place on "Waylay" maps, which are small, do not appear on the World Map (so you cannot click on
them to revisit them), and do not allow you to Rest or Save the game while you're there. In BG1, all random encounters take place in the wilderness, but in BG2, there are also encounters that take place between city maps. BG1 random encounters tend to be sensitive
to the terrain you are passing through: The waylay maps themselves, and the creatures in them, are similar to the adjacent maps & their resident creatures. The Order of the Stick cartoon is <i>mostly</i> correct: There is a maximum of 1 random encounter between any
two map areas, true, but some longer journeys are routed through specific "waypoint" areas. For instance, in BG2, all traffic in & out of Athkatla must go through the City Gates map, so if you are on Map A <i>in</i>side the city and you want to go to Map B 
<i>out</i>side the city, what looks like a single journey is actually two: Map A to City Gates, and then City Gates to Map Bótwo separate trips, making for a small chance of getting waylaid twice in a row.<td width=5><td><img src=images/oots0145.jpg></table><br>

<b>Random Spawns:</b> Most maps are populated with enemies who are scaled to be an appropriate challenge for the party: As soon as the party enters the map area, the game checks what types of creatures are appropriate to find on that map, and sets their number
and relative strength based on the EXP Level of the main character. Since a large percentage of map areas (in both BG games) are available to characters just starting the game, yet could also be postponed until much later in the game, adjusting enemies to suit
party strength is a solid way to keep things appropriately challenging.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A related matter is <u>re</u>spawning: If you clear a map of all enemies and then return to it some time later, it will have a new batch of creatures in it. This happens most often with wilderness maps, and simulates new creatures
wandering in from the surrounding lands to fill the vacated territory/ecological niches. Respawns can even occur if you stay on the same map for more than a couple of hours (although certain maps, and even individual spawn points within those maps, may have their
own timers), which is actually noticable in some cases, creating situations where you come back through a portion of dungeon that you had "just" cleared, only to find it full of Kobolds again. Respawns can also be prompted by Loading the game: If you clear a map,
then Save/Reload, all of the random spawn points will be repopulated.<br><br>

<b>Reaction:</b> This is an evaluation of how likely the average person on the street is to react favorably to you; based on a combination of the party's Reputation and the Charisma of the party member actually doing the talking, it determines whether or not the
person you're talking to will be willing to answer your questions, tell you about quests, give you the news, etc., as opposed to simply telling you to get lost.<br><br>

<b>Reputation:</b> A way to keep track of what the general public thinks about you, your, party, and what you've all been doing. Reputation ranges from 1 (Despised) to 20 (Heroic), and responds to your actions in-game: Deeds like rescuing infants from burning
buildings, saving towns from outbreaks of disease, and donating significant amounts of money to Temples (even Temples to <i>Evil</i> gods) cause your Reputation to go up. Deeds like getting caught stealing, killing innocent civilians, and fighting officers of the
law cause your Reputation to go down. The Reputation you have at the start of the game depends on the Alignment you select for your character. During the course of the game, your Reputation influences such things as how much stores will charge you to buy goods, and
your Reaction score.<br><br>

<b>Resistances:</b> There are three main types: Magic, Elemental, and Physical.<br><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic47.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Magic Resistance is the percent chance that a magic spell will have no effect on you whatsoever. If you have 25% MR, then you have a 1 in 4 chance of completely shrugging off a hostile spell, no matter how nasty its effects might have
been. Some spells can still partially get through, however, because their effects are broken up: If somebody casts a Magic Missile at you (5 individual missiles), you have a 25% chance to deflect each of those 5 missiles, calculated separately, so you're likely to
be hit by 3 or 4 of them. Similarly, if you're standing in the AoE of a Web spell, your MR grants you immunity on a round-by-round basis, not just once for the whole duration of the spell. Also, in BG2, many spells ignore Magic Resistance. These are usually
beneficial spells (it would suck if the party Priest couldn't cast Free Action on you because you Resisted it), but be warned: Some offensive spells will bypass MR as well. In BG1, MR can stop <b>any</b> spell, including things like healing spells. Spells that you
cast on <i>yourself</i>, however, will always automatically get through. The only advantage in going higher than 100% Magic Resistance is as a preemptive measure against enemies casting <font color=007700>Lower Magic Resistance</font> on you.</table>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elemental Resistances: There is one for each of the 6 types of elemental damage: Fire, Cold, Electrical, Acid, Poison, and Magic Damage. Each of them indicates the % reduction of the damage taken, when you are hit by damage of that
type. If you have 20% Electrical Resistance and are hit by a Lightning Bolt, the game calculates how much damage you should take, and then inflicts only 80% of that damage on you. 100%, of course, grants you complete immunity to all Electrical damage, and you can
even exceed 100% (the maximum for any resistance is 127%) so that Electrical damage will actually <u>heal</u> you. Creatures strongly attuned to a particular element are very frequently highly resistant/immune to that type of elemental damage (<i>e.g.</i>, Fire
Elementals are completely unharmed by Fire). "Magic Damage" is a specific damage type, frequently used by spells such as Magic Missile and Larloch's Minor Drain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Physical Resistances: There is one for each of the 4 types of physical damage: Blunt, Missile, Piercing, and Slashing. These function exactly the same as the Elemental resistances, reducing the amount of damage you take from damage of
that particular type. They are frequently used to make creatures more vulnerable to one type of weapon than another: For example, if you're fighting a Skeleton, you're not going to have much luck trying to shoot it or stab it, because the arrow/blade will just go
right between their ribsóyou'd be better off smacking it with a Warhammer or something. So BioWare gave Skeletons some Piercing and Missile Resistance, but no Blunt Resistance. It is possible to make your Physical Resistances exceed 100%, and thus be healed by
enemies hitting you, but this idea makes almost no realistic sense at all.<br><br>

<b>Resurrection:</b> Death is not always permanent in D&D, and the two main ways of returning from it are Raise Dead (available only at Temples in BG1, you cannot cast it yourself) and <font color=007700>Resurrection</font>. PnP has various rules &
regulations about these spells, and <b>none</b> of them were implemented in Baldur's Gate. Here's how the spells work in-game: Raise Dead and Resurrection both have a 100% chance of returning the target to life, regardless of their Constitution. You can use Raise
Dead on a character who has been dead for more than 24 hours. Bringing a party member back to life has no permanent negative effects on said party memberóit does not lower their Constitution by one point, or subtract 1 of their levels. Elves and Half-Elves can be
Raised and Resurrected just as well as any other race. You do not actually have to possess the dead person's remains to restore them to life (a Mage with 3 Strength can "carry" all 5 of his deceased friends to a Temple simultaneously), but they do have to be in the
party.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here's how creatures (including party members) can die permanently: They can be chunked (either through massive damage or a Vorpal hit), they can be Petrified and then damaged (which shatters the statue), they can be 
<font color=007700>Disintegrate</font>d, they can be hit with spells/attacks that have a chance of Disintegration (such as <font color=007700>Prismatic Spray</font> and <font color=007700>Black Blade of Disaster</font>), their
last hitpoints can be lost to Cold damage (which freezes their body into an ice statue, which always shatters a second later), or they can die through <b><u>any</u></b> means and then be booted from the party. Or they could be the main character, to whom ANY death
is permanent death.<br><br>

<b>Round:</b> See Time.<br><br>

<b>Saving Throws:</b> For your defense against physical attacks, you have your Armor Class. To guard against spells and spell-like effects, you have Saving Throws. There are five Saves in total: Save vs. Death (usually to avoid being Poisoned or having the life
sucked out of you, etc.), Save vs. Breath Weapon (used when a Dragon breathes fire at you or something), Save vs. Petrification/Polymorph (to avoid drastic harmful alterations to your physical form), Save vs. Wands (used when a spell is cast through a
Wand/Staff/Rod, or when such an item is used to hit you), and Save vs. Spells (the catch-all Save, also invoked when you're trying to avoid the effects of many actual spells). Now that I've said that, <b>forget</b> that I've said there are 5 Saves, because there
are really only two: Over 95% of the Saving Throws you will roll in the game are going to be either Death or Spells . . . the other three might as well not even exist.<br>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><img src=images/jesus.jpg alt="another 20, lol"><td width=5><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As for how Saving Throws actually function, let me give you an example. A Level 8 Mage casts Fireball at youóthe spell does 1D6
per level of Fire damage, with a Save vs. Spell for half. So every creature in the area of effect takes 4D6 damage (that much is unavoidable), and for each of them, the computer rolls a D20 for their Save vs. Spell; let's say that you rolled an 11. All creatures
have Saving Throws, just like they have AC. If you were a Level 8 Human Mage, your own Save vs. Spell would be 10. Since your Save vs. Spell <u>roll</u> was equal to or higher than your Save vs. Spell <u>stat</u>, congratulationsóyou made your Save, and take no
further damage from the Fireball. If you were a Level 8 Human</table>
Fighter, however, your Save vs. Spell would be 13. You rolled an 11, which is less than your personal Save vs. Spell stat, and so you fail to Save and take another 4D6 Fire damage. Saving Throws are another aspect of the game where, counterintuitively, you want
your numbers to be as <b>low</b> as possible. If you get all of your Saves to be 1 or lower, you will always make every Saving Throw (except possibly if the spell has Save penalties), because there is no such thing as a "Critical Save" or "Critical Fail" like
there is with physical combat. Now, many spells carry bonuses and penalties to Saving Throws, and these can be confusing because the descriptions are frequently contradictory: A +1 bonus to your Saving Throws actually causes your Saves to <b>de</b>crease. A +1
bonus to your Saving Throw <u>roll</u> is the same thing as a -1 bonus to your Saving Throw <u>stat</u>, etc. Confused yet? In this guide, I will always describe Save bonuses and penalties from the perspective of the creature on the <i>recieving</i> end of the
spell, the creature that has to actually make the Save. A "+1 penalty" means that the spell is 5% more difficult to Save against, a "-2 bonus" means it's 10% easier, etc.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Be warned: Some spells & effects don't allow a Saving Throw at all.<br><br>

<b><font color=007700>Set Traps:</font></b> Although it's hardly a "must-have" like Find Traps and Pick Locks, the Set Traps skill can be quite a useful ability. At any point in the game where there are no hostile creatures within his line of sight, a
Thief can attempt to set a Trap near the point where he is standingóthe game rolls a D100 and compares it to his Set Traps score. If he fails the roll, the attempt is wasted, and if he fails it badly enough, the Trap will actually go off and injure the Thief
instead of his intended victim. If the roll is successful, however, the Trap will remain in place until it is set off by a hostile creature passing within 15 or 20 feet of it (even flying creatures such as Wyverns can set them off). The Trap then fires an arrow
which unerringly strikes the hapless creature, doing a fair bit of damage and sometimes Poisons the target as well. No more than 7 Traps (set by the party) can exist in any one map area at one time. Thieves gain their first use of Set Snares (the game calls them
Snares, but nobody else does, because they obviously look like bear-traps) at Level 1, with additional uses gained every 5 levels thereafter. There is no point in investing more than 100% in the Set Traps skill.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set Traps can be approximated through the use of certain spells like Skull Trap and Glyph of Warding.<br><br>

<b>Special Ability:</b> Any type of usable skill or talent that a creature has, especially if it's a spell-like effect, is a Special Ability. Party members have Special Abilities too, accessible through the button on the bottom right of the screen, the one with
the 4-pointed star, when that particular party member is selected. Special Abilities are usually conferred by one's class or kit (such as a Ranger's Charm Animal ability, or a <font color=007700>Priest of Helm</font>'s True Sight), but abilities like
ToB <font color=0000ee>HLA</font>s are displayed here as well. Certain NPCs may also have Special Abilities that are unique to them, personally. Some spells also give you Special Abilities: For example, <font color=007700>Polymorph Self
</font> adds abilities like "Shapeshift Ogre" and "Shapeshift Mustard Jelly," which are accessible at will until the duration of the spell expires.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In some rare cases, certain skills that would normally be in your regular bottom-row buttons get pushed over into the Special Abilities list, simply because the game ran out of room. For example, a Cleric/Thief has so many buttons
(Weapon, Spell, Turn Undead, Stealth, Detect Traps, Thieving, etc.,) that there just isn't enough space to fit them all, so BioWare had to stick their Thieving button behind the Special Abilities icon.<br><br>

<b>Speed Factor:</b> Each type of weapon has a Speed Factor, which determines at what point in the round the attack will actually be made. A Speed Factor of 4 means that at the start of each round of combat, the character will wait for 4/10ths of the round to
pass, and then attack. Cumbersome weapons such as Flails and Crossbows have the slowest Speed Factors, and small weapons like Daggers have the quickest. Note that the Speed Factor of your weapon does NOT affect how rapidly you can attack with it (that is
determined solely by your Attacks per Round), it simply reflects how long it takes between the time you issue the Attack command, and when the attack is actually made. It is important largely only for characters attacking from Stealth, where a quicker Speed
Factor can give you a second chance at a Backstab (before you become visible) if you missed the first time.<br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
<b>Spellslots:</b> Unlike most magic systems, where the ability to cast spells is based on the possession of sufficient "mana," D&D uses a system based on "spellslots." All magic-users have them; the higher the spellcaster's EXP level, the more spellslots they
have, and the higher the levels of magic they can reach. For example, a Level 4 Mage has three Level 1 spellslots (slots which can be used to cast a Level 1 spell) and two Level 2 spellslots (slots which can be used to cast a Level 1 spell). When that same Mage
gains a level and reaches EXP Level 5, he will have 4 Level 1 slots, the same 2 Level 2 slots, and a new Level 3 slot. Before the party Rests for the night, the Mage goes through his spellbook and chooses what spells he thinks he is likely to want to cast the
next day; he chooses those spells by "placing" any of his known spells into his spellslots for memorization. Known spells can be memorized as many times as you have spellslots at that level; higher-level spells cannot be memorized in lower-level slots, or vice
versa. The next day, the spells are memorized and ready to be castóand once cast, they leave the spellslots vacant, and cannot be cast again without another 8-hour period of uninterrupted sleep.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic14.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass">
</table><br>

<b>Stealth:</b> A skill that enables the user to walk around, unseen and unheard. Only Thieves, Rangers, and Monks can Stealth, and their success depends on their Stealth rating (Thieves & Monks choose how many points per level to invest in the ability, while
Rangers' Stealth is based solely on their level and Dexterity), and to some extent the amount of ambient light in the area (darker is better). It is only possible to enter Stealth mode while no hostile creatures are in your line of sight, although once you are in
Stealth, you can walk around freely and remain unseenóas long as your luck holds. In BG1, there was only the one skillóStealthówhich in BG2 was broken up into the skills of <font color=007700>Hide in Shadows</font> and <font color=007700>Move
Silently</font>. The way the game engine was set up created a bias that makes Move Silently far more important than Hide in Shadows (an imbalance that I find unfortunate): When you attempt to enter Stealth, the game takes your HiS and MS scores,
averages them together, and compares that average with the result of a D100 roll (plus or minus any modifiers due to light conditions where you're standing). If you succeed, the game then continually checks to see how long you will remain hidden: The chance of
staying concealed, the length of time that elapses between checks, and how long you will remain unseen after a failed check, all depend on your Move Silently score. One important benefit of this ability is that all Stealthed characters recieve
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic29.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>a -4 THAC0 bonus; this affects only the hit they make while emerging from Stealth, of course, but it's still quite helpful.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While in Stealth, any action other than walking will cause the character to leave the shadows: Some actions merely "break Stealth," meaning you can quickly perform the action, move back out of sight range of any enemies, and drop
back into Stealth again, without ever becoming visible. You will break Stealth if you pick a lock, open a door, attack a creature, or begin casting a spell, but you will still remain invisible for a time dictated by your Stealth or Move Silently score. Other
actions, however, will cause you to <i>immediately</i> become visible; these include actually landing a hit on an enemy, finishing casting a spell that breaks Invisibility (pretty much all hostile spells do this), opening a container, or picking an object up off
the ground.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Thief's Stealth skill can be approximated, as I said, by Monks and Rangers, and also by several types of Illusion spells available to both Priests and Wizards.</table><br>

<b>Straight:</b> Not an indicator of sexual preference, in BG terms this means a relatively unadorned character class: It is used to refer to a "straight Paladin," meaning a Paladin who has not taken any of the Paladin <font color=007700>kits</font>.
Synonyms include "pureclass," "true-class," and "vanilla." Depending on context, it can also mean a character who <u>does</u> have a kit, but is neither a Dual-class nor a Multi-class (<i>e.g.</i>, a straight Diviner, as opposed to a Fighter->Mage or a
Cleric/Mage.)<br><br>

<b>Tank:</b> This is the character who runs toward the enemy and gets their attention (drawing aggro, if you play World of Warcraft) to bait them all into attacking <u>him</u>, rather than other party members. This poor bastard has to soak up all their damage and
spells, not to mention haul around all the armor he has to wear if he wants to take all that damage and stay alive. Tanks are the linchpin of pretty much any combat encounter, and I discuss them in much more detail in Chapter 9.<br><br>

<b>Time:</b> The basic unit of time is the round. Ten rounds equals one turn, and 6 turns make one hour, in game-time; in real time, a round lasts for 6 seconds and an hour is over in 6 minutes. When you Rest, it must be 8 uninterrupted hours, or it won't count:
Your magic-users will not memorize their spells, and X-per-day items will not be recharged. Just like on Earth, 24 hours make a day, although there are about 14 hours of daylight per day because the game is set in Toril's Northern Hemisphere, during summer. Time
in the Sword Coast is usually measured in 'tendays,' rather than 'weeks,' as is the custom in some other regions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Most combat encounters are over in no more than 10 rounds. Apart from walking around and attacking, characters can perform only one "action" in any single round: Casting a spell, using a Special Ability, drinking a Potion, using a
Wand, all of these have a "cooldown" period that forces the character to wait before another such action can be attempted, although a character <i>can</i> cast a spell and fight in the same round, if both the spell and the attack are quick enough.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "How much time do I have to complete this quest?" Most quests, including the Main Plot, have no time limit at all, but that's only a general rule. If the person telling you about the errand gives you a specific deadline ("Meet me at
my chambers in one hour"), they tend to mean it. If they're rather vague about it ("The city is in danger! You must hurry!"), you can usually dink around for months and it won't make any difference. Try to prioritize your quests in order of urgency (help put out
the burning building <u>before</u> you go on that archaeological expedition to find curios for a museum), and you should be able to complete them all without anyone getting mad at you because you took too long.<br><br>

<b>THAC0:</b> The acronym stands for "To Hit Armor Class Zero," and is a measurement of how likely you are to score a hit in combat. What the game does is take your target's Armor Class, factors in the creature's Dexterity, applies any AC Modifiers it may have
against the type of weapon you're using, and (in some rare cases) any additional AC bonuses it may have when attacked by creatures like you. That number is the creature's Effective AC. The game then takes your base THAC0, and applies any bonuses or penalties from
the proficiency you have in the weapon you're using, your Strength or Dexterity scores, the enchantments on your weapon, and (in some rare cases) any THAC0 adjustments you may have when attacking creatures like your target. <u>That</u> number is your effective
THAC0. Finally, the game makes the actual Attack Roll, with a D20. The all-important equation is this: <b>( THAC0 - AC =< Attack Roll )</b>. If this condition is fulfilled, that is, if the number on the D20 is <i>greater than or equal to</i> your Effective THAC0
minus the target's Effective AC, then you have succeeded in hitting them. If the die shows a number <i>less</i> than the result of the calculation, however, then your attack missed. So, as the attacker, there are three things that improve your odds: You want your
own THAC0 to be very low, you want your enemy's AC to be very high, and you want the die roll to be very high. Of course, if the die roll is a 1 or a 20, the attack is automatically a Critical Miss or a Critical Hit anyway, so the game actually does that part
first, before it goes through the business of crunching all those numbers. See AC.<br><br>

<b>Turn:</b> See Time.<br><br>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
<b>Turn Undead:</b> Clerics and Paladins possess the ability to Turn Undead, which is to forego combat for the sake of chanting holy rites that are abhorrent to all forms of Undead. They can use this ability whenever they want, for as long as they want, although
taking any action other than walking around will cause them to stop Turning Undead. Once per round, a wave of invisible energy sent by the Cleric's or Paladin's god will sweep out from his body, affecting all Undead creatures within a radius of about 20 feet.
Clerics and Paladins each have a Turn Undead Level: Clerics Turn Undead at the same level as their EXP Level, while Paladins' Turn Undead Level is (their EXP Level - 2). All Undead creatures in the area of effect of a Turn Undead chant must compare their own EXP
Level to the TU Level affecting them: If the TU is less than or equal to their EXP, nothing happens. If the TU is a little bit higher than their EXP level, the Undead creature(s) must flee, usually in Fear. If the TU Level is <i>noticably</i> higher than the
Undead's EXP Level, they will either explode on the spot, dying instantly (if the Cleric or Paladin is of Good or Neutral alignment), or become Charmed and do their new master's every bidding (if the Cleric is of Evil alignment).

<b>Vanilla:</b> Used to refer both to basic character classes (see Straight), or to the games of BG1 and BG2 in their default, original forms, without any mods installed.<br><br>

<b><font color=007700>Vorpal:</font></b> Inspired by The Jabberwocky, a "Vorpal" weapon is any weapon that has the power to instantly slay its victim, regardless of how many actual hitpoints they may have left. To avoid such weapons from overpowering
everything else in the game (whether we're talking about BG or PnP), Vorpal weapons are usually only vorpal on a certain percentage of their hits, and/or allow their victims a Save vs. Death to avoid the effect of instant fatality. It is important to note that
these weapons usually cause death because they are "magically sharp," meaning that whatever they hit, they chop clean offóBioWare chose to implement this as dismemberment, meaning that a party member killed with a vorpal weapon cannot be resurrected. Therefore,
creatures capable of Vorpal hits should be handled with extreme caution.<br><br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you truly are new to the game of either BG1 or BG2 (or perhaps even both), then you are in a rare and very enviable position: Almost <i>all</i> experienced players wish that they could erase all their memories of the game, solely to play it through all over again and experience each new major battle and plot twist as if it were for the first time.
    This is pretty much your ONLY chance to play the game for <b><i>yourself</i></b>: All future runs will be colored, for better or for worse, by your metagaming knowledge of your first game, and very likely from people online telling you things that you actually don't need (and likely don't even <u>want</u>) to know. Therefore, treat your first game as something special, because it
    is—you cannot recreate your own inexperience. My advice to you is this: Stay away from <u>all</u> other websites about the Baldur's Gate series, especially forums and MOST especially walkthroughs, until you have beaten the game under your own steam at least once. If you truly, absolutely, <i><b><u>need</u></b></i> help with some part of the game, ask on an online forum—search
    for threads related to your problem, and if you don't find any, start a new thread asking for help. But if you just start reading random threads, you WILL spoil the game for yourself.<br><br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here are some general pointers that should be invaluable in helping to make your first game enjoyable:<br><br>
    
    <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>

    <br><center><b>This is a Newbie Note.</b></center><br>You will find them sprinkled throughout this Guide; they contain information that is very fundamental, and therefore <i>critical</i> for you to know. At the very least, read this whole chapter, and the Newbie Notes of Chapters 5, 6, and 7. They'll give you some important warnings and clue you in as to what the hell you're
    doing . . . and if you don't, your experience with this game is less likely to be fun.<br><br>Ideally, you should also at least skim through the portions of Chapters 8 and 9 that are relevant to the (section of) the game you're currently in, or alternatively keep them open in another window, so you can refer to them while you're playing. Chapter 2 is worth a look, as well.
    </table></table>
    
    <td width=10><td>Do <b>NOT</b> read Chapter 4 of this guide—<b>yet.</b> Character Creation is a very important process that requires a huge amount of explanation, and trying to digest it all in one sitting, especially when you're impatient to start playing, is practically <i>guaranteed</i> to eat your brain. So instead of poring over all of Chapter 4 until your eyes fall out, and
    then intensely weighing the pros and cons of each of your myriad options against one another, I'll make it easy for you: <b>Build a Paladin (any type) or a Fighter (Trueclass or Berserker).</b> If you choose to be a Fighter, I would strongly suggest going with Dwarf or Halfling as your race. Be sure to max out your Dexterity and Constitution (those are the stats that keep you
    alive), and give yourself at least 15 Strength (you need to be able to carry heavy armor). For weapon proficiencies, in BG1 Bow, Blunt, and Large Sword are all pretty good bets. In BG2, I would discourage putting points into Club, Spear, Halberd, Bastard Sword, Katana, or Scimitar until after you've located some weapons worth investing in.
    <br><br>The game is heavily weighted towards people roleplaying Good characters . . . the Reputation discount is an excellent indicator of this. Make your main character of any Good alignment, choose party members who are Good (or at least Neutral), and run around being kind & polite to everyone. While it's quite possible to run a game as the most Evil sadist imaginable, it takes
    a lot of familiarity with the game to do so without screwing yourself out of some quests, items, and EXP.<br><br>
    Don't try to rob law-abiding folk unless you're <i>sure</i> you can make a clean getaway. Getting caught stealing, and maybe having to kill a city guard or two, is a sure way to destroy your Reputation—and maybe your party—remarkably quickly.</table>
    
    <br>Travel with a full party of 6, as much as possible. If this means taking on Evil party members, so be it—just remember that they're only temporary placeholders until you find somebody more to your liking. You want a full party not only because of the sheer numerical advantage it gives in battle, but it also allows you to have a more well-rounded party, and gives the
    bad guys more targets other than <b>you</b> to shoot at.<br><br>
    Be good to your Thief, and be sure your Thief is damned good.</b> Grizzled old campaigners like me know where the Traps are—you, on the other hand, should keep your eyes glued to the ground at all times, at least when you're in areas known to harbor intelligent opponents. Also, use Stealth to scout ahead whenever possible: We know where the dangerous enemies are, too—but 
    <b><i>you</i></b> certainly don't want to go charging around a corner without knowing whether you're going to come face-to-face with a Gibberling or a Beholder. Yes, Reloading is a wonderful feature, but do you really want to do it every 2 minutes?<br><br>
    Don't try to argue with a railroad plot. There are certain points in both games where BioWare took steps to ensure that the Main Plot could never get stuck—these "steps" usually take the form of <u>killing</u> the PC if he has managed to royally screw up. By and large, I agree with their reasons, it's just their methods that are a little heavyhanded.<br><br><hr><br>
    
    Of great importance is your <b><font color=cc0000>Install Order:</b></font> If you don't patch your game, or install the fixes in the wrong order, you're going to encounter <font color=cc0000>bugs</font> in your game. First off, if your computer is running Windows Vista or Windows 7 as its operating system, you <u>shouldn't</u> install the Baldur's Gate games in their default
    root directory (C:\Program Files\Black Isle\) because the computer will automatically try to resist any changes made in the Program Files directory: You can <i>play</i> the games just fine from the default directory, but it'll be more more difficult to cheat or mod the game (more on that later). So just make a new directory, C:\Baldur's Gate or something, and install there.
    If you're running an earlier operating system, though, you're already good to go.<br>

    <center>Keep that mouse pointer moving, and pay close attention to what it looks like. Some of the more important pointer-icons are as follows:</center><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse4.gif><td width=10><td>The "Stairs here" pointer, which appears when the mouse is hovering over the head or foot of a stairway that serves as an exit from your current area.
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse5.gif><td width=10><td>"Door here," appears over doorways. You may need to click to open the door before you can pass through. This is important because some buildings have their
        entrances facing North, and therefore invisible from your overhead viewpoint, so the only way to see the doorways is by mousing-over them.
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse6.gif><td width=10><td>"Travel", appears near the very edges of outdoor maps. Clicking here (when your whole party is gathered near the spot) takes you to the World Map, where you
        can travel to other map areas.
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse3.gif><td width=10><td>"Cast Spell Here." Spells are targeted at the creature or patch of ground at the very top-left corner of the icon.
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse7.gif><td width=10><td>"Thieving", your mouse-pointer icon after clicking the Thieving bottom-row button. It will change into a Lockpick, Trap, or Cutpurse icon when hovering over
        (respectively) a locked door or container, a Detected Trap, or a creature.
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse1.gif><td width=10><td>The "You can't walk here" pointer, appears over all impassable areas (like walls, deep water, off the edge of cliffs, etc).
        <tr><td valign=top><img src=images/mouse2.gif><td width=10><td>The "Use This Device" pointer, which is rarely used. It appears over miscellaneous stationary objects that you can either use or perform some action upon.
        Note that it can be mistaken for "You can't walk here" if you aren't paying close attention.</table><br>
    
    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The "Travel" pointer is particularly important in BG1, because it's how you "explore" and find new map areas to visit. Suppose you're traveling westward, and the country ahead is completely unknown to you. When you reach the western edge of your current map area, move your mouse to the edge (it should turn into the Travel pointer) and click. You
    will be taken to the World Map, where the map area(s) directly west of you are now visible, even if they weren't before: You have looked "over the horizon" of the map that you're still on, and have seen these other lands. If they are map areas that you've already been to, they are colored black, but if you haven't visited there yet, they are colored blue. From the World Map
    screen, you can travel to ANY blue or black map area on the map, or alternatively click the map that you're on (or press Esc) to stay where you are.<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Traveling is somewhat different in BG2: Instead of exploring the wilderness, you travel directly to your destination, and new map areas are revealed not by "discovering" them, but by having a <u>reason</u> to go there: If you talk to Flydian and learn that he wants you to go to Trademeet, *BAM!* Trademeet is now marked on your World Map. If a map
    is marked in gray, though, you can't go there yet: In most cases, this is because traveling to country areas would requite you to pass through the gates of the city, so you must first visit the City Gates map, and exit <i>through</i> the gates. Realistic, but awkward. The screenshot at right shows the gates, and the area marked in red shows where your mouse becomes the
    "Travel" pointer to leave the city. No, nobody knows what that scrawled sign over the gates is supposed to mean.<td width=10><td><img src=images/gates.jpg></table><br><hr><br>
    
    <center><b>If You have Played one Game, But Not the Other</b></center><br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Perhaps you're an old hand at BG1, but this will be your first game of BG2, or vice versa. There are some important fundamental differences between the games, as follows:<br>
    1) Walking Speeds. Although the "Movement Rate" variable is the same in both games (6 is normal), all of the actual walking speeds are about 25% faster in BG2 than they are in BG1. This can be disconcerting at first, but you soon get used to it.<br>
    2) Bumping into People. In BG1, all creatures are immovable objects: They can walk around and all, but if they're in your path, you have to go around them—they only way to get them out of your way is to kill them. This can be quite annoying in cramped spaces, where you find that you can't move because there's some stupid Commoner just standing in the hallway scratching his
    ass. In BG2, however, as long as you're not actually in combat you can push people aside: You just walk normally, and any creatures that are standing still automatically get bumped out of the way as you pass.<br>
    3) Combat AI. In BG1, most enemies try to attack whichever party member they see first, and <i>keep</i> attacking him as long until something else deliberately attracts their attention. In BG2, however, more varied creatures have more varied AI behavior, such as preferring to attack any visible target of Class[Mage] over any other target that is not a Mage, or randomly
    switching targets without any obvious reason, just to make the combat as a whole less predictable. Some (flaky) AI scripts don't take the creature's sight range into account, and assume that "If Character X is in your party, Enemy Y must be in sight range of Character X," which can lead to things like an enemy suddenly breaking off combat with your Tank to go attack your
    Cleric, even if the Cleric is halfway across the map and the enemy has no reason to suspect that you even <u>have</u> a Cleric. There are several mods that improve the computer's AI, making them less likely to do stupid/unrealistic stuff like this.
    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic21.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>
    4) In BG2, you gain EXP for scribing Wizard spells to your spellbook (the amount varies with the level of the spell successfully scribed), as well as for Disarming Traps and Picking Locks (the amounts for which vary with the EXP level of the Thief). These actions do not grant EXP in BG1. Also, if you are playing BG2 with ToB installed, you can <i>erase</i> Wizard spells from
    your book if you wish to—this can come in very handy when you find a new scroll that you want to scribe, but you've already reached the maximum number of spells (of that level) that your Intelligence stat will allow you to have.<br>
    5) In BG1, killing creatures while they are Neutral to you means you earn only 10% of that creature's listed EXP value. This dynamic appears to have been dropped in BG2.<br>
    6) Party members get Fatigued differently. In BG1, all characters seem to get worn out when they've been awake for 24 hours (give or take any modifiers from their Constitution). In BG2, though, it's apparently more like 48 hours, and there seems to be a modifier for their Class as well: The recruitable Thieves and Mages in the game, at least, seem to get tired
    <i><b>long</b></i> before their Warrior counterparts do.</table>
    7) Dispel Magic goes through a <i>major</i> change. In BG1, any casting of Dispel Magic removes <u>all</u> active magical enchantments in the area of effect, no matter what. In BG2, however, the chance of a successful Dispel depends on the difference in EXP levels between the person who cast the original spell, and the person trying to Dispel it. If the two casters are the
    same level, the odds are 50/50. If the caster trying to Dispel is of a higher level than the original caster, the Dispel is more likely to bring down the existing magic. If the person casting Dispel is <b>lower</b>-level, however, the odds of the Dispel working are close to 0 (this is a <font color=cc0000>bug</font>).<br>
    8) BG2 allows you to take a quick glance at your foes during combat, to see how wounded they are. Mouse-over any Hostile creature to check out how much they're bleeding—along with their name, you'll also see one of the following: Uninjured, Barely Injured, Injured, Badly Injured, or Near Death.<br>
    9) In BG1, going to your Inventory screen automatically <b>un-</b>Pauses the game, making switching weapons in the middle of a fight potentially a very hazardous process. In BG2, opening up your Inventory automatically <b>Pauses</b> the game.

    <br><b>Chapter 4: Character Creation</b><font size=3></center><br><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the most important facets of D&D / BG is the ability to create the character you will "inhabit" for the course of the game. There are dozens of options available to you, which when combined allow for a spectrum of
        literally <i><b>billions</b></i> of possible characters. The Character Creation process itself can be deceptively simple: Choose what race you want to be, pick a class to play, select an alignment, roll a decent set of stats, put some proficiency
        points into a couple of weapons, maybe choose a couple of spells, done. Actually <i>understanding</i> the reasoning behind all of those choices, however, is a lot of work, and there is <b>much</b> data to be absorbed and weighed. I have arranged this
        page so that the various aspects are not in the order in which they appear during the actual Character Creation in-game, but rather in the order of greatest importance to your character as a whole.<br><br>
        
        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your <b><u>Class</u></b> is essentially your profession, the set of skills that determine your role as an adventurer. Each class has its own relative strengths and relative weaknesses, as well as abilities unduplicated
        by any other class. There are four "super-classes": Warrior, Priest, Rogue, and Wizard, and each superclass has at least two "classes" descending from it. In BG2, almost every class has at least three "kits" descending from <i>it</i>.

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b><u>Dual-classing and Multiclassing</u></b> are ways to combine two (or three) very different classes, or even one class and a kit of another class, in the same character. Both methods increase your end
        versatility at arguably little cost, so in general Dual-classes and Multi-classes are a bit more popular than trueclass characters.<td width=10><td><img src=images/menu2.jpg usemap="#menu" border=0></table>

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your <b><u>Race</b></u> is the species from which you are descended. Although this decision has little influence on actual gameplay, it has great importance in determining what classes (especially class combinations) you

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your <u><b>Stats</u></b> are measurements of your (character's) personal abilities; things like physical strength, ruggedness, brainpower and charm. Different stats are important for different classes, and each class
        and race will influence your stats somewhat: Minimum values, and a few bonuses & penalties here and there. But by far the most important factor in determining your stats is the roll of the dice; getting good stats is easily the most time-consuming
        part of Character Creation, which is why going through the process is most frequently described as "rolling" up a new character.

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b><u>Weapon Proficiencies</u></b> are indicators of your levels of skill with various types of weapons, and BG2 introduces Weapon Styles as well. Most of your proficiency points will be allocated during the course of
        the game, but you have enough at the start to get you going. Your character is affected a good deal by what weapons they use: A Warrior who uses a Flail and Darts from behind his Large Shield is very different from another Warrior (even one with the
        exact same race, stats, and kit) who uses a Crossbow and Spear, who in turn is very different from one who Dual-Wields Short Swords.

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your <b><u>Alignment</b></u> has hardly any influence on the game—even if you're Lawful Evil, you can still behave in a manner more consistent with Chaotic Good, and vice versa. It serves mostly as a reminder of how you
        <i>should</i> be playing than any sort of real restrictor on your actions. In BG2, though, there are a few items that have Alignment restrictions, so it does matter in that regard, and it has some small effects at the beginnings of both BG1 and 2, 
        and also determines what Familiar you will get (if any).<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href=#align>Click Here</a> to jump down to the section on Alignment.<br><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Selecting your starting <u><b>Spells</b></u> is pretty trivial: If you're a Wizard, you pick what spells you know at the start of the game (people typically go with either the most-commonly-used ones, like Magic Missile
        and Identify, or the hard-to-find ones like <font color=007700>Glitterdust</font> and <font color=007700>Spook</font>), as well as which spells you have memorized on Day 1. If you're a Priest, choosing your memorized spell(s) is your only option.
        Picking your memorized spells only happens in BG1, because in BG2 you always start with no spells memorized at all. There is no section to read more about your starting spells, because I just said all there is to say about it.
        
        <br><br><a name="stats"><hr><br>
        <center><b>Character Creation — Stats</b></center><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every creature in the game has six basic, fundamental statistics that play a large part in determining that creature's capabilities and influencing its secondary statistics like hitpoints and THAC0. The stats are 
        Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), & Charisma (CHA). The "normal" range for each of these stats is 3 through 18, with the average score in each stat being 8 or 9; most commoners and townsfolk have
        average stats, while adventurers' stats are almost always considerably higher, for the simple reason that if their stats were only average, they wouldn't have become adventurers. Here's a description of the 6 stats and what they do:<br><br>
        
        <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><b>Strength:</b> Your Strength is, obviously, a measurement of sheer physical muscle. It affects your odds of hitting an enemy with a melee weapon, how much damage you can do with that melee weapon, your
        chances of forcing open a locked door or chest (in the event that you don't have a Thief), and in BG2, what weapons and armor you can use: If you want to wear Full Plate, you need at least 15 Strength. Your Strength also determines how much weight you
        can carry and still move at your normal walking rate; if you go even a single pound over your Weight Allowance, you become Encumbered: Slowed and lumber along at half speed. Exceed your Weight Allowance by more than 20% or so, and you're Encumbered:
        Can Not Move. Warriors can also get something called "Exceptional" Strength, which is a modifer that the AD&D people threw in because <i>everybody</i> was giving their Warriors 18 Strength. If you're a Warrior and your STR is 18, the game will also
        roll a D100 that determines your exceptional STR. 18(01) is the lowest, as it's only a tiny bit more powerful than a flat 18, and 18(00) is the best, it's almost 19. Most party members will not need a high Strength, but they should be at least average
        . . . this goes for <i>every</i> stat, actually.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic32.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table><br>
        <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic20.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td><b>Dexterity:</b> Your agility, reflexes, eye-hand coordination, and manual sensitivity. This is arguably the most important stat: It influences
        your Armor Class, your aim with all ranged weapons, and (if you're a Thief, Ranger, Bard, or <font color=007700>Monk</font>) your Thieving skills as well. Of these, your AC is the most vital, as over the course of the game a <u>lot</u> of people are
        going to want to insert a <u>lot</u> of pointy objects into you, and it would be much to your benefit not to be there when it happens. Therefore: Dodge.<br><br>
        <b>Constitution:</b> This stat represents your toughness, endurance, gumption, and stamina. It controls a very important number: Your maximum hitpoint total. Actually, your CON score is only one factor in setting your total hitpoints; good die rolls are
        every bit as important, but with things as precious as hitpoints, every one counts. Only Warriors gain any additional hitpoints for a CON higher than 16. Constitution also plays a major role in determining the Saving Throws of a Dwarf,
        Halfling, or Gnome. One very interesting thing about Constitution is that extremely high</table>CON scores allow you to actually regenerate lost hitpoints; this starts at a CON of 20, in which case your wounds self-heal at the rate of 1 hitpoint per
        turn. It's not much, but it sure is nice when you can heal yourself just by sleeping, or walking from one map area to another. Despite what the manual says, your Constitution has no effect whatsoever on your odds of being successfully Resurrected.<br>
        <br><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><b>Intelligence:</b> This stat reflects your capacity to learn, remember, deduce and outwit. It is largely important only to Mages and Bards, as their odds of successfully scribing a Wizard scroll to their
        spellbooks depends wholly on their INT. (Note: Intelligence is only required to <i>scribe</i> the spell, not cast it. The manuals show an INT table that says you cannot cast high-level spells without a high Intelligence, <i>e.g.,</i> you must have at
        least 16 INT in order to cast 8th-Level spells. This rule was <u>not</u> implemented in BG.) Also, when scribing spells, the game checks your INT and use it to determine how many spells (of each Spell Level) you can scribe to your Book. But apart from
        spell-scribing purposes, Intelligence is only good for Lore, and the ability to use certain items: People with less than 9 INT are treated as illiterate in PnP, and in BG this is implemented by making all scrolls, even the green Protection scrolls,
        unusable by anyone with under 9 INT, and the same goes for almost all Wands, as well. Some encounters in BG2 also roleplay your INT for you: Depending on the Intelligence of the party member doing the talking, the more clever or learned conversation
        options might not be open to you.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic13.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table><br>
        <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic08.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td><b>Wisdom:</b> A representation of your common sense, levelheadedness, foresight, and intuition. These four qualities are actually hardly touched
        in the game; true, a high Wisdom does grant you the same Lore bonuses as having a high Intelligence, and some conversation options do check your WIS score as well, but the only thing that WIS is <i>really</i> good for is memorizing additional Priest
        spells. Apparently Wisdom is also a measure of one's devotion to the gods, because Clerics and Druids gain extra spellslots for having a high WIS. (Paladins and Rangers do not get these bonuses, and of course the <font color=007700>Monk</font> cannot
        cast spells at all.) In PnP, your Wisdom is used to determine a modifier on your Saving Throw against spells that affect the mind—Charm and Confusion effects and the like. Despite the fact that BioWare included a mention of this in the manual, this was
        <u>not</u> implemented in the final game. Also unimplemented was a Spell Failure chance, wherein Priest spells cast by a Priest with a low Wisdom score would have a random chance to spontaneously fail, without any external source of Spell Disruption.
        Regardless, for all classes other than Clerics & Druids, Wisdom plays hardly any role in a character's effectiveness.</table><br>
        <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><b>Charisma:</b> This is a measure of your character's willpower, personality, physical appearance, and leadership abilities. It is most commonly equated with good looks and sex appeal, but this is only a part
        of what Charisma represents (it's a <i>big</i> part, but still). In your interactions with the hundreds of NPCs in the game, their attitude toward you is controlled by two things: Your party's Reputation, and your Charisma. (Actually, some conversations
        check the Charisma of the party member who's actually talking to the NPC, while others check the Charisma of the Party Leader.) With a high Reputation and high Charisma, you tend to get offered more quests and recieve better rewards for completing
        them—conversely, in one game of mine I couldn't even <i>talk to</i> a recruitable NPC because my Reputation and personal magnetism weren't high enough to impress him. (Yet another example of how the game favors roleplaying Good.) A prime example of how
        Charisma affects various NPCs' Reaction scores to you is the prices in stores: Polite, pretty, persuasive people get discounts. Store prices are also greatly influenced by the party's Reputation, but the Charisma of the Party Leader tends to be even more
        important.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic40.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table><br><br>

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you are curious enough about what the stats actually <u>do</u> that you want the actual, numerical values for them, visit the <a href=stats.htm>Stats Table</a>. Otherwise, we now know enough about the stats to finally
        talk about <b>rolling</b> them. In PnP games, different Dungeon Masters have different rules for rolling stats; one common setup is that you roll 4D6, ignore the lowest die, and the remaining 3D6 is your roll, totalling anywhere from 3 to 18.
        Do that 6 times, and those 6 numbers are your stats—end of story. If you really did get some lousy numbers, the DM might let you roll a <i>second</i> time. In comparison, BioWare is the nicest DM in the
        world, because here's how it works in BG: The game rolls 6 sets of 3D6, and compares the results with three pre-set criteria.
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1) All 6 stats must be within the Minimum and Maximum<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp parameters for the Race you selected.
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2) All 6 stats must be at least the minimum values for the Class you<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp selected.
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3) The numerical sum of all 6 stats must be at least 75.
        <br>If any one of these criteria are not met, the game immediately rolls another 6 sets of 3D6, without even displaying the one that didn't make the cut. Once the game has found some valid numbers, it displays them, and then lets you move points from one
        stat to another. Many DMs allow this, but with restrictions on the number of points you can move, or with penalties for raising a stat above 15, or things like that. Not BioWare: In BG you can move stat points around to your heart's content. And as if
        that wasn't enough, you can roll a completely NEW set of 6 3D6 stats, simply by hitting <b>Reroll</b>, as many times as you want. BioWare also nerfs the game in your favor by allowing you to select your Class <u>before</u> rolling your
        stats. In PnP, you rolled your stats first, and they determined what class(es) you could be; if you didn't roll at least 12 WIS and 15 CHA, you couldn't be a Druid. This acted as a restrictor on being able to play powerful classes like the Ranger and
        Paladin. In BG, however, all you have to do is select a Ranger, and you're practically <i>guaranteed</i> to get good stats on every roll.</table><br>
        
        <b>Q: "If I roll 3D6, that gives a point spread of 3 to 18. So how do I get a 19, for stats like a Half-Orc's Strength? Do I have to take a point out of some other stat, and move it into STR?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: No.</b> A normal 3D6 dice
        roll is 3 through 18, yes, but do you see how a Half-Orc's Strength range is 4 through 19? That's just a regular 3D6 roll, with a +1 modifier tacked on. I've already included all the modifiers in the table above, so you don't have to worry about them.

        <center><b>Character Creation — Proficiencies</b></center><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Proficiencies can be assigned to various weapons and, in BG2, <font color=007700>Weapon Styles</font> as well. They represent the amount of time and effort you have spent in training with the selected weapon (style), or at
        least they're meant to: You can pour 5 proficiency points into Mace, even though you've never used any weapon but a Halberd, so that the first time you ever pick up a Mace, you're already a Grandmaster with it. Okay, so the system can be abused, there's
        nothing new about that. The Proficiency Tables for BG1 and BG2 are different, largely because BG1 takes place at such low levels that you have very few proficiency points to throw around, so BioWare chose to lump certain weapons together, giving players
        greater flexibility when it came to using weapons in which they were proficient. The tables for BG1 and BG2 are below:<br><br>
        
        <center><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr>

        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As you can obviously see, BG2 offers a heck of a lot more choices when allocating proficiency points than BG1 does, and while in BG1, every proficiency gives you skill with at least two types of weapon, in BG2 almost
        all weapons have their own proficiency slot. The "Max." column indicates the maximum number of points that can be put into each proficiency. The 5th point in each of BG1's proficiencies is red because there's no way to actually achieve Grandmastery in
        BG1.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When starting BG1, no class of character can put more than 2 points into any weapon proficiency, to reflect the idea that no piddling little Level 1 character could be considered a "Master" of anything. When you start
        BG2, however, you get to re-allocate all of your points (even if it's a character you carried over from BG1, you can put his points into entirely different proficiencies), and you can go straight to Grandmastery from the very beginning.
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the description of Single Weapon Style, your "offhand" is your left hand, a term used most often when Dual-Wielding (the more commonly-used name for Two Weapon Style) or using Single Weapon Style. Two-Handed Weapon
        Style only applies to <i>melee</i> weapons, it will not affect the use of your Longbow.
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As for what the proficiencies actually <b>DO,</b> well, that too differs between BG1 and BG2, as shown below. The tables indicate the various THAC0, Damage, Attacks per Round, and Speed Factor bonuses given by one's
        proficiency in the weapon(s) being used.

        <td width=10><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the table shows, you recieve no positive modifiers when using a weapon in which you have 1 single proficiency<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>point. If you use a type of weapon in which you have <i>no</i> proficiency points, you actually incur
        <i>penalties</i>: You can only make 1 Attack per Round, and your THAC0 is penalized depending on your character class: Warriors take a +2 hit to their THAC0,
        Priests and Rogues have a +3 modifier, and Wizards suffer under a whopping +5 THAC0 penalty.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic31.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table></table>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The effects of increasing proficiency in a weapon are the same in BG1 as they are in PnP, but they change dramatically in the transition to BG2 . . . most notably, the benefits of going beyond Specialization almost disappear. Many people
        were annoyed by this change, and created a "True Grandmastery Patch" mod that changed BG2's system back to the BG1 setup. It has been "decided," however, that with the more powerful weapons available in BG2, using BG1's numbers would result in Fighters becoming overpowered,
        especially in comparison to their non-Warrior companions. Part of the reason for this is that non-Warriors do not get the Attacks per Round increases for advanced weapon specialization; sure, Priests, Rogues, and even Wizards will enjoy the appropriate THAC0, Damage, and Speed Factor bonuses from
        whatever level of proficiency they're able to achieve with their weapon(s), but the only way to have your Proficiency Points grant you extra ApR is to have at least one level of Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger under your belt. This is hardcoded.<br>
        
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <font color=007700>Weapon Styles</font> do not use the same point-progression that the actual weapon proficiencies do; rather, each Weapon Style has its own setup, as follows:
        <table cellspacing=2 cellpadding=4 border=1><tr bgcolor=ffffff><td><center><b>Points<td><center><b>Sword & Shield Style<td><center><b>Single Weapon Style<td><center><b>Two-Handed Weapon Style<td><center><b>Two-Weapon Style

        <tr bgcolor=988676><td bgcolor=ffffff><center>**<td>AC vs. Missiles now -4<td>AC bonus now -2, rolls a Crit on 19 or 20<td>Damage bonus still +1, Speed Factor now -4, rolls a Crit on 19 or 20<td>On-hand THAC0 penalty negated, offhand penalty now +4
        <tr bgcolor=988676><td bgcolor=ffffff><center>***<td><center>-<td><center>-<td><center>-<td>Reduces THAC0 penalties to +0 in the on-hand and +2 in the offhand</table><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dual-wielding with <b>no</b> points invested in Two-Weapon Style gives THAC0 penalties of +4 in your on-hand (right) and +8 in your offhand (left). An explanation of Dual-Wielding: Carrying a second weapon in your offhand automatically gives you an
        additional Attack per Round, but you only swing your offhand weapon once per round. For instance, if you had an ApR of 3 while holding a Mace, and you picked up a Dagger in your offhand, your ApR would jump to 4, and every round your attacks would be Mace, Mace, Mace, Dagger. If
        you were <font color=007700>Improved Hasted</font>, your ApR would double, and you would now attack Mace, Mace, Mace, Dagger, Mace, Mace, Mace, Dagger, every round. Your overall Speed Factor is determined by the weapon in your on-hand, not your offhand; the number of proficiency
        points invested in your offhand is actually irrelevant, the game only uses your proficiency with your on-hand weapon when determining combat bonuses. (You should still have at least 1 proficiency point in your offhand weapon, though, even if just for the sake of realism.)
        
        <br><br><a name="align"><hr><br><center><b>Character Creation — Alignment</b></center><br>
        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your Alignment is a representation of your overall personality and outlook on life. It is determined by your (character's) standing on two axes: The Good-Evil axis and the Lawful-Chaotic axis. Each axis
        has 3 positions, and when combined, the axes delineate a set of nine alignments, as shown to the right. One's Alignment is pretty much the only "stat" that is almost entirely subjective and open to interpretation: It is not a box to put you in, but rather a tool to help you
        roleplay. Without an Alignment that's permanently attached to their character, people would always have their characters do what they themselves, the <i>players</i>, would do—meaning that if you played the game over & over, all of your characters would react the same way
        to every situation. Thus, having an Alignment improves the replayability of the game, by reminding you that "Oh yeah, I'm Lawful Neutral this time."
        <td width=10><td><table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 border=1 bgcolor="white"><tr><td><center><font color=00cc99><b>Lawful Good<td><center><font color=00dd00><b>Neutral Good<td><center><font color=66bb66><b>Chaotic Good<tr><td><center><font color=1111ee><b>Lawful Neutral

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Good-Evil axis is fairly self-explanatory: Good is the cause of altruism, putting others before yourself, and aiding those in need, while Evil is the cause of
        selfishness, total lack of compassion, and milking every situation for all you can get. Upon discovering an abandoned purse, with a wallet and keys inside, a Good person would feel obligated to wait for the owner to come back, and/or leave her a note telling her that they'd found
        her purse, and how to contact them. An Evil person would just say "Finders keepers" and quickly take at least the money in the wallet, if not more.
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Law-Chaos axis is one's attitude towards, and willingness to obey, authority and the existing power structure. Law favors order, tradition, and upholding the <i>status quo</i> for its own sake, while Chaos views all boundaries as shackles on
        a person's true independence, and seeks to circumvent or disrupt social mores. Upon becoming aware of a moderately serious flaw in, say, their local system of government, a Lawful person would try to work within the system, getting it to recognize its own problem and amend itself
        accordingly . . . this solution would likely take quite some time, but in the end it's the most efficient. On the other hand, a Chaotic person who percieved the exact same problem in the system would likely try to attack, or even destroy, everything connected with the flaw . . .
        possibly doing more harm than good, but at least they can be sure that their actions have some effect.<br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp True Neutral is an interesting alignment, partly because there are many completely different reasons to be it. TN functions as the "Null" alignment for creatures too mindless to have an alignment of their own: Skeletons, Golems, and most types of
        animals are TN simply because they lack the capacity to understand the concepts of Good, Evil, Law or Chaos. The second main reason to be TN is through either the lack of a moral opinion, or the inability to act on that morality. Most poor commoners fall into this bracket, because
        they are so concerned with work and caring for their families that they don't have the time (or schooling) to take a<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><img src=images/alignment.jpg><td width=10><td>moral stand, and even if they did they'd still lack the resources to
        <u>do</u> anything about it. These people do what they do because they'd die if they didn't. The third main reason to be True Neutral is out of the desire to oppose extremes. Most people in this group are Druids, viewing all those who favor Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos as being,
        literally, unbalanced (which is not a problem as long as there's an oppositely-unbalanced equal to swing the scale right again). These people do not seek to <i>eliminate</i> things like Good and Evil, instead they see a positive need for both viewpoints to coexist, for out of strife
        comes growth. These people seek to preserve all opposing factions from extinction, and they will aid the weak not because they are being oppressed by the strong (as a Good person would do), but rather simply <u>because</u> they are weak, just as they will stand against the strong
        simply <u>because</u> they are strong.
        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The alignments of LG, CG, LE and CE combine elements of both their parent alignments in a rather intuitive fashion—a Chaotic Good person will kill an Evil person, simply because they <i>might</i> perform an Evil action at some point in the future.
        Meanwhile, a Lawful Evil person will build a case of "evidence" against his enemies until the authorities give him a free hand (or even assistance) to execute those who got in his way. There are also <i>more</i> alignments than just the basic nine, but these are
        more vague and they don't even have names, just things like "Neutral Good with Lawful tendencies" and "Chaotic Neutral with Evil tendencies." But really, as long as you're roleplaying a character who is morally realistic, it's all good.</table><br>

        <br><b>Chapter 5: Running a Party and Combat</b><font size=3></center><br><br>
    
            <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/durlagroof.jpg><td width=10><td>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just as Chapter 4 exhaustively covered all possible options open to you in Character creation, in this chapter I'll be discussing the basics of directing the <u>other</u> 5 party members: Selecting NPCs to accompany you, keeping those NPCs happy,
            controlling the positional arrangement of your party members, managing their equipment, etc. The second half of this chapter is given to a brief overview, including some fundamental tactics, of what many people think the Baldur's Gate saga is all about: Fighting.<br>
            
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Getting a recruitable NPC to join your party is pretty easy: You just talk to them, like you would any NPC, and over the course of the conversation you'll learn whether or not they're the adventuring-type sort or person. Maybe <i>they'll</i>
            suggest tagging along with you, maybe you'll have to bring it up yourself. Some NPCs may refuse to join you if you don't say the right thing(s) . . . of these, it's possible that some may wander off and never return, others might give you a second chance. Like all NPCs,
            recruitable NPCs have conversation trees that check their Reaction to you; if they're displeased by your low Charisma and/or poor Reputation, they too will likely refuse to join your group. Some NPCs can be difficult to recruit due to their placement in the game . . . this is
            more prevalent in BG1</table>than BG2 (BG1 has 4 potential party members located in areas that are completely inaccessible until you've completed more than half of the Main Plot). Some NPCs might also only be present/recruitable under specific circumstances, but these are,
            happily, very rare. On the whole, recruiting NPCs is danged easy, like I said. Sometimes, you don't even have to talk to them yourself, they'll see you walk by, and come & talk to <b>you</b>.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once an NPC joins your party, you'll see their portrait appear in the column in the
            right-hand side of the screen, which is also used to show each party member's relative health: If a character is injured, the proportion of his hitpoints lost to wounds is equal to the percentage of red shading over his portrait. You may recieve a small amount of gold when a
            new party member joins: As soon as they're in your party, the stuff they're carrying is yours to control, including the loose change in their pockets. As a way of making them more unique, some party members will have items that only <i>they</i> can use; sometimes this is done
            by having the items permanently welded to that specific Inventory slot (a so-called "nonremovable" item), and sometimes it's done by giving the item very specific requirements, so that it can only be used or worn by someone of the exact same race, class, and alignment of the
            specific NPC, and having stats that are at least as good.<br>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You can also kick NPCs out of the party: Just go to any character's Records screen, where there's a button marked "Reform Party." Clicking that lets you select which party member(s) to give the boot.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some NPCs come in pairs: When you recruit or disband one of them, the other one follows.<br><br><br>
            
            <center><b>Party Makeup</b></center>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Chapter 3, I strongly recommended traveling with a full party of 6, as much as possible. You may or may not agree, many people like to play Solo games at least occasionally, but personally I'm a sucker for good party balance. The "classic"
            6-man party is this: 3 Warriors (usually a Fighter, a Paladin, and a Ranger), a Cleric, a Thief, and a Mage. On the whole, this is basically correct, but let me express it in terms of ideals instead:
            <center><table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3><tr><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1 bordercolor=ff8800 bgcolor=ffffff><tr><td><table cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2><tr><td><img src=images/newbie.jpg><td width=10><td>
            1) Ideally, the party should be at least half Warrior.
            <br>2) Every solidly balanced party needs—note that I said <u>needs</u>—a good Thief, or at the <i>very</i> least a third of one.
            <br>3) Ideally, the party should have high-level access to both sides of the Priest scroll; both Cleric <b>and</b> Druid spells.
            <br>4) Ideally, the party should be between 15% and 25% Wizard, and be able to cast from all 8 Schools of magic.
            </table></table></table></center>
            The explanations of these guidelines are as follows:<br>
            1) The ability to wear Plate armor, Helmets, and Shields is very important, and while Clerics can do this just as well as Warriors, there are certain useful potions that only Warriors can drink, and of course a Cleric does not have a Warrior's all-important combat stats. For
            90% of all encounters in the game, the #1 thing that can make it go smoothly for you is havin' a heapin' helpin' of Warrior (or <font color=007700>Monk</font>) meat on your side.<br>
            2) It's true that almost all of the Thief skills can be approximated by other classes. With a Ranger, a Monk (or possibly a Familiar), and a Bard with every Level 2 spellslot filled with Knock, it's <i>possible</i> to do a lot of Stealth, Detecting Traps, Pickpocketing, and
            busting open Locks. It's also <i>possible</i> to go camping and carry along a can opener, a saw, a couple of screwdrivers, a pair of scissors, a knife or two, tweezers, and an awl . . . <b><i>or</i></b> you can carry a Swiss Army knife. Besides, Thieves are the only means of
            actually <u>Disarming</u> Traps, and they're also the only people who can Detect Illusions, which can be a very handy skill at times.<br>
            3) On the whole, Clerics get some damn good spells that Druids do not, but Druids also have a couple that I'd hate to be without. Having one of each in your party isn't a necessity by any means, but it does help. You really should have at least ONE class of Priest represented
            in your party, in BG2 anyway . . . in BG1, Priests are mostly used just for healing, so a Cleric is only a little better than a few Healing Potions every day, so a moderately experienced player could easily buy a bunch of Potions instead, and use that extra 6th slot to
            recruit another Warrior. Druids are actually worth <i>less</i> than a stack of Potions in BG1, because they don't get any truly good spells until BG2.<br>
            <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
            4) In a party of 6, a primary Mage and a backup Mage (1.5 Wizards) is a party that's 25% Wizard. Having two arcane casters working simultaneously can be a good asset, pulling off properly-timed combos like a <font color=cccc00>Greater Malison</font> immediately
            before a <font color=007700>Flesh to Stone</font>, or chucking two Fireballs simultaneously. Having a backup Mage is also a good way of making sure all bases are covered if there are certain important spells that your primary Wizard cannot learn. I must note that "You should
            try to have about 1.5 Wizards" is only my suggestion for BG2, not BG1; the combat in BG1 is very Warrior-oriented, and half of the time a Mage would only get in the way, somebody to worry about while your Fighters are busy kicking ass. It's
            not until BG2, when Wizards get better spells and more spellslots to put them in, that they truly come into their own.<td width=10><td><a href=images/wizards.jpg>
            <img src=images/twizards.jpg alt="A party wherein all 6 members are at least part Wizard. An unusual setup, but you can make it work if you know what you're doing."></a></table>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "A third of a Thief" or "half a Mage" are expressions for ways in which a party member can be used. A Multiclassed Fighter/Cleric is clearly half of a Warrior and half of a Priest, a pattern that holds true for all Multiclasses. Dual-classed
            characters are more complicated and abstract; a Thief who Dualed to Mage at around Level 13 could be considered "half" of a Thief, because he had earned enough Thieving Points to reach nearly 100% in half of all Thief skills, but at the same time he's about 90% of a Mage,
            because he'll be only 2 levels behind a pureclassed Wizard. A Bard can also be considered half of a Mage.<br>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Of course, these are just guidelines, not carved-in-stone laws by which you must abide. Build whatever sort of party you think is best, this is just my advice on what I think is likely to work best for you.<br><br><br>

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are three main things that can infuriate a party member: Being in a party whose Reputation is wildly at odds with their personal Alignment, being in a party with certain specific other NPCs with whom they do not get along, and having a
            personal quest that you either attempted and really screwed up, or never attempted at all.</table></table>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The table at left shows how party members of different Alignments feel about how you've been running the party and the decisions you've been making as the party leader. If you're having them perform actions that they don't feel right about,
            they start to complain. If this pattern continues, they get verbally aggressive, and become more likely to leave the party if you say or do something that upsets them. Finally, when you reach an extreme end of the Reputation scale, they will Break from the party, and either
            wander off never to be seen again, or outright attack you. If you kick an NPC out of the party while he's feeling Unhappy (or worse) about the way you've been running the show, he will deliver a few choice insults before leaving, and that's the last you'll ever see of him—or
            the equipment he's carrying. But if he's feeling neutral or happy about the party's Rep, he'll almost always either stay where he is, or go to some agreed-upon location, and wait for you to come back so he can rejoin.<br>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Certain NPCs do not play well with certain others, that's just a fact of life. In both BG1 and BG2, there are some specific NPCs who hate each others' guts (or personalities, or ideologies, what-have-you). But take heart: Such pairings are
            rather rare, and there are warning signs. Most importantly, it's generally a bad idea to mix Good and Evil NPCs in the same party, that in itself can cause a lot of friction. Secondly, problems can also be foreseen if Character A says that he hates people who are X, and
            Character B <b><i>is</i></b> X. So, if you've got a Lawful Good <font color=007700>Sorcerer</font> and a Chaotic Evil <font color=007700>Wizard Slayer</font> in the party, you're going to be seeing a lot of sparks, and chances are they're going to try to kill each other. I
            suppose it's <i>possible</i> to get all the way to the end of the game with party members that are supposedly "unmixable," by Reloading every time somebody says something nasty, but that would be a pain. From what I've seen, the odds of interparty conflict are decreased if
            you (the PC) have a high Charisma, and increased if either (or even both) incompatible NPCs aren't happy with the way you've been directing the party.<br>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp NPC quests are more common in BG2, but BG1 has its share as well. They're essentially just like any other quest, except that the person who gave the quest is in your party. Sometimes they'll mention the quest the first time they join your
            party, while some party members have quests that don't pop up until later in the game. Regardless, once you have some</table>specific information on what they want done, it's best to place that quest fairly high on your list of priorities: If you put it off for too long, the
            NPC will get sick of waiting for you and leave the party, either to strike out on his own or to attack you. Don't worry, you'd have to let their quests wait for quite a while (days or weeks, depending on the immediacy of the quest) before party members would freak out like
            that, and they always give you reminders first.<br><br><br>

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the party is walking from one place to another, their relative positions are controlled by the Marching Formation that you select. Whenever 2 or more party members are selected, the bottom-row buttons turn into icons for choosing
            different Marching Formations—and right-clicking any of those buttons allows you to access even more, so you've got quite a lot of freedom. The default formation for both BG1 and BG2 is the rectangle: Two party members walking side by side, followed by 2 more right behind
            them, who are followed in turn by 2 more right behind <i>them</i>. If you want, you can choose a formation that has the whole party walking in single file, or marching

            abreast, or in a circle, etc. Personally, I prefer the pentagon formation, as it allows me to place my best
            Tank on point, two backup Tanks on the wings, my two weakest archers at the back, and the center position can be any type of character: Another weak archer (safely protected in the center), another backup Tank (ready to follow right in the Tank's footsteps), or a flank
            attacker (safely screened from the enemy AND ready to jump into melee). The thing that determines <i>which</i> party member occupies <i>which</i> position in the formation is the Marching Order, which is the order of the portraits on the right-hand edge of the screen. To
            change the Marching Order, just click & drag the portraits up & down. In BG1, the Party Leader (the very top portrait, whether that's the Main Character or not) always occupies the "point" position regardless of what Marching Formation you're using, while in BG2, different
            formations have the Party Leader in different spots. Experiment and see what works best for you.

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And hey, I just used a bunch of terms with which you may or may not be familiar. It's definition time!
            <br><b>Tank:</b> The designated "front-man" of the party, the most heavily armored person in the group, whose function is to attract the enemy's attention and get them to<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp focus all their attacks on <u>him</u>, instead of the lightly-armored
            Thieves and Mages in your back rank. I'll be discussing Tanks in greater detail in a few moments.
            <br><b>backup Tank:</b> Although not the party's primary Tank, these guys are rugged enough to act as a temporary substitute if he gets badly injured, or some enemies<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp managed to slip past him. Most parties (should) have at least two backup
            Tanks.
            <br><b>flank attacker:</b> Any party member that possesses a strong melee <u>off</u>ensive, but whose <u>de</u>fensive abilities are crap: <font color=007700>Monks</font> and <font color=007700>Kensai</font> are the best examples of<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp this.
            Flank attackers can only function when a Tank is present to take the heat; once the Tank has the bad guys' attention, the flank attacker can charge in and<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp clean up.
            <br><b>archer:</b> Not to be confused with <font color=007700>Archer</font> with a capital A, which is a Ranger kit, archers are all party members whom you would prefer to keep out of melee<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp combat (against anything but the very weakest of
            enemies), due to their lack of armor and relatively feeble combat stats. The entire Wizard and Rogue<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp superclasses are almost always relegated to archer roles in a party.
            <br><b>Party Leader:</b> The very top portrait on the right-hand edge of the screen. While your character, the PC, is the <i>leader of the party</i>, he is not necessarily the Party<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Leader. The Party Leader is the "spokesman" of the group,
            the one who (when the whole party is selected and you want to talk to an NPC) does the talking,<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and also the one who does the haggling when you're buying things in a shop. (Also, because of the way EXP is divided among party members, he
            recieves a<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp slightly larger amount of EXP than anyone else).<br><br><hr><br>
            
            <center><b>The Care and Feeding of a Tank</b></center>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If all you're concerned about is winning a <i>particular</i> fight, offense is probably more important than defense: It's all right to take some damage, because you can heal yourself later, but if you lack the means to kill the enemy, then
            you're guaranteed to lose. But if your aim is to win <i>many</i> engagements in a single day, then the very highest priority is a strong defense: You obviously can't use an entire day's worth of healing spells after every single scuffle, and if you have to bring 2 or 3 of
            your party members back from the dead after every moderately important battle, you are going to get absolutely nowhere. That's why many parties use Tanks, concentrating all of their very best defensive equipment onto the party member with the very best natural defensive
            abilities, and then using him to bait the enemies into attacking the <u>one</u> party member that they <u>cannot</u> hit. This frees up all your other party members to fire ranged weapons and spells at their convenience, without having to worry (much) about coming under
            attack themselves.<br>

            Building a Tank: Juggle your available equipment to get the best possible values on 1 character. In order of priority, they are: AC, Saves vs. Death and Spells, Hitpoints, Immunities to specific effects, Magic Resistance, Elemental Resistances, and Physical Resistances.
            Then you give that character at least 1 Quickslot full of the best Healing Potions you've got, and you push him in the enemy's collective face.
            </table></table></table><td width=10><td>You'll notice that I don't mention THAC0 or ApR in my list of important Tank characteristics. That's because, although the Tank is used in a very <u>off</u>ensive manner, running up to the enemy and all, his actual function is a
            thoroughly <u>def</u>ensive one. Being able</table>to serve as a strong melee attacker and a Tank at the same time is great, of course, but largely unnecessary, as your archers, backup Tanks, flank attackers, and casters should be able to tally up a large number of kills
            on their own account. Note that no matter <i>how</i> well you cover your Tank in thick armor plating, he's never invincible: You're certain to run into boss-type enemies whose THAC0 is low enough to penetrate even your Tank's defenses, and of course there are always
            Critical Hits. So your Tank <i>will</i> be taking damage, he'll simply be taking much <i>less</i> damage than the party would suffer if he were gone. In the event that your Tank has become so heavily injured that keeping him on the front line anymore would be a serious risk
            to his life, simply pull him back while sending up a backup Tank or two to take his place. Sending up replacements is a very important step: 90% of the time, the enemies will attack the first party member (or allied creature) that they see, and <i>continue</i> to attack him
            until something forces them to re-evaluate what target they should be aiming at. Most of the time, they will switch to the target creature that is currently attacking <b>them</b>, which only makes sense. So if your party is walking merrily along, you may find that your Mage
            has somehow blundered his way to the front of the group (which happens fairly often, annoyingly enough, Marching Order or no Marching Order), and was the first person seen by a pack of Hobgoblin Elites, who cheerfully aim a score of poisoned arrows at your Mage's soft white
            underbelly. When this happens, you have to get your Tank up in the Hobgoblins' faces as quickly as possible, to make them put their Bows down, switch to a melee weapon, and attack the person that's attacking them (your Tank). But it's unlikely that your Tank will be able to
            distract all of them at once, so you also have to pull your Mage back out of the Hobgoblins' sight range, or some of them will still keep shooting at him. Note that the Tank doesn't actually <b>have</b> to stay in melee range of those enemies he's distracting: If all they're
            carrying is a melee weapon, he can dance all over the place and they'll still follow, unless something prompts them to attack a different target. But it's a good idea to keep your Tank

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your Tank should ALWAYS be carrying a full stack of Healing Potions, so that if he gets badly injured he can heal himself quickly, without interrupting his Tanking duties. Healing Potions are to be used when you're in combat, Healing

            one that completely disregards armor. If your opponent is a solo spellcaster, your best Tank is going to be a party member with very high Magic Resistance and/or very low Saving Throws. With the
            powerful array of defensive spells in BG2, it so happens that the best possible Tank is a Wizard (or Bard)—it's just that they can only hold that Tanking position for a very short time each day.<br><br><br>
            
            <center><b>A lot can happen in a Round</b></center>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The most important unit of time in combat is the <b>round</b>, which (in real time) is six seconds long. During a round, five kinds of things can take place: Attacking, casting a spell, using an item or ability, using a "state," and walking.
            <br><b>Attacks</b> are limited by the number of Attacks per Round each character has. A creature with 2.5 ApR does not actually make 2 and a half attacks in each round; rather, he makes 3 in the first round and 2 in the next. Depending on the Speed Factor of your weapon, it
            is possible to attack and perform any other action in the same round, though not at the exact same time.
            <br><b>Spells</b> may be cast at the rate of 1 per round. It doesn't matter if you have 2 spells that have an almost-instantaneous Casting Time of 1, you still can't cast them during the same round. The PnP explanation for this is that casting a spell creates a certain
            amount of magical pollution in your personal aura, and you must wait until your aura is clean before you can access the Weave again. You also cannot use an item or Special Ability in the same round that you cast a spell, but depending on the Casting Time of your spell, you
            will be able to do a certain amount of walking, attacking, or entering a state during that same round.
            <br><b>Items</b> such as Potions, Scrolls, and Wands (and others) can also only be used at the rate of 1 per round, and not in the same round as a Spell or Ability.
            <br><b>Special Abilities</b> such as a Paladin's Detect Evil or a Thief's <font color=007700>Set Snare</font> are also limited to 1 per round. Again, an Item cannot
            be used during the same round as an Ability cannot be used during the same round as a spell. As far as I know, PnP provides no explanation for this. After (or before) using your item or ability, you can walk, attack, or use a state before the round is over.
            <br><b>States</b> are the semi-passive actions of Turn Undead, Stealth, Bard Song, and Detect Traps/Illusions. You can walk around freely with any of these states in effect, but taking any other action (including activating another state) will cause the state to end.
            <br><b>Walking</b> can be done during the same round as any of the above actions, though (with the exception of states) never at the same time.<br><br><br>
            
            <center><b>Why you need Stealth</b></center><br>
            <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The most important weapon you could <b>possibly</b> have in the kinds of combat situations you'll find in-game is just this: Knowledge of your enemy. You need to know if the enemy lurking around the
            next corner is a Gibberling or a <font color=007700>Beholder</font>. You need to know the enemy's positions, their numbers, how many of them are likely to be spellcasters, their probable strengths and weaknesses. With Stealth, you can do this. I have said that the Thief
            skills of Detect/Disarm Traps and Pick Locks are <b>must-have</b> abilities for your party; Stealth is even MORE important,
            <td width=10><td><table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3><tr><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=460 border=1 bordercolor=ff8800 bgcolor=ffffff><tr><td><table cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2><tr><td><img src=images/newbie.jpg><td width=10><td>Almost all creatures in the game have the
            exact same sight range: If you can see them, they can see you. Therefore, just about the ONLY safe way to scout out the enemy is by using Stealth.</table></table></table></table>
            especially for a player who's unfamiliar with the game. Doing some simple, regular scouting is frequently the deciding factor in just who gets to take whom by surprise, especially if you have spellcasters in the party: There's nothing like scouting ahead, discovering a
            cluster of enemies just over the hill, and coming back to warn the rest of your party—so you can cast some buffing spells if you think it's warranted, and then have your Mage stand just out of their sight and let fly with a Fireball, softening up the area right before your
            Tank goes charging in. Other tactics include bringing the party around to attack their group from the "rear," if they seem to have one, or even separate your party to attack from 2 or 3 directions simultaneously, trapping the enemy in a pincer movement before they even know
            you're there.<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic11.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stealth is also useful for its own sake: Any Stealthed or Invisible creature gets a -4 THAC0 bonus (which of course vanishes after the first successful hit breaks the creature's Stealth / Invisibility), so your Thief should try to be in
            Stealth as much as possible, just for the increased chance of connecting with his first shot. There is also the tactic of Backstabbing, which Thieves (and, in BG2, <font color=007700>Stalkers</font>) can do: While in Stealth, you move behind your enemy and attack with any
            melee weapon that a pureclassed Thief can use. (Yes, you can Back<b>stab</b> with a Blunt weapon.) You don't have to be <i>exactly</i> behind them; the arc of valid Backstab positions is pretty large, even being just over their shoulder is good enough. Anyway, you attack,
            and if your attack connects, the damage done is multiplied by your Backstab multiplier, making for a particularly damaging strike before the enemy even knows they're in danger. A good Backstab can frequently kill the target instantly. Not all enemies are vulnerable to
            Backstab; some, such as Slimes and related creatures, have no "back," while others, such as Golems, have no vital organs or other particularly vulnerable areas in which to strike. The enemy can Backstab, too, and due to a quirk of the game engine, they don't</table>have to stand
            behind you to do it—you can get Backstabbed right in the face if that happens to be the direction you're looking. Very few enemies in BG1 will try to Backstab you: BioWare decided that such a (potentially) powerful attack being used on (potentially) low-level characters
            with relatively few hitpoints was a bad idea, as seeing your party members get chunked by an enemy you couldn't even tell was there tends to be Not Fun.<br><br><br>
            
            <center><b>Using your AI</b></center>
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp BG1 and BG2 come with a number of artificial-intelligence scripts, which your party members can use when you're not giving them specific instructions. These are useful for letting you decide just how closely you want to micromanage your
            party. There are scripts that make the user shy away from melee combat and use ranged weapons instead, scripts that have Stealth-capable characters attempt to Stealth whenever possible, scripts that have characters attack every enemy they see, scripts that automatically
            cast Healing spells on any party member that could use one, etc. You can assign different scripts to individual party members, or even no sript at all, and in the bottom right of the screen is the "Party AI On/Off" button, which you can leave On when you want to party to go
            on on autopilot for a while, and Off when you enter some hairy combat and you want to make sure you have absolute control. The AI script that I most commonly select for my characters is called "Fighter Aggressive" in BG1, and "Standard Attack" in BG2. It's the script that
            tells party members to attack all visible enemies—all decisions of a higher level than that are decisions I'd prefer to make for myself; that's just my personal preference.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Each party member's AI is reset to the game's Default every time they join (or rejoin) you, so if you're in the middle of a fight and the new guy is just standing around, it's probably because you forgot to assign him an AI.<br><br><br>
            
            <center><b>Spells and Spellcasting</b></center><br>
            <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><a href=images/armor.jpg><img src=images/tarmor.jpg alt="Area-of-Effect spells rule. Anyone wanna buy some cheap armor?"></a><td width=10><td>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Most of my discussion of spells is in Chapter 7, of course, but no discussion of combat would be complete without covering the basics. In the majority of fights, the most dangerous types of spells are Area-of-Effect (AoE) spells, and 
            Save-or-Die spells. AoE spells are those that can affect a large number of creatures; while Magic Missile can only harm a single target, a Horror spell can affect all creatures standing within 30 feet of the creature or point selected by the caster. AoE spells can be
            devastating in combat situations, particularly against victims that are bunched close together (like your party). Save-or-Die spells are those where the victim(s) can make a Saving Throw; if successful, the effects of the spell are negligible, but if the Save fails, the
            victim is either dead (such as <font color=007700>Finger of Death</font> or <font color=007700>Disintegrate</font>), or</table>
            might as well be (such as Sleep or <font color=007700>Flesh to Stone</font>). All spells that cause the effects of Hold, <font color=007700>Stun</font>,
            or Unconsciousness are considered Save-or-Die, because an immobilized character has no defenses at all: When any creature that cannot move is attacked, the game doesn't even roll the die, all attacks automatically hit. (Which means, ironically, that you can't get a Critical
            Hit against a helpless enemy.) Your enemies know easy prey when they see it (in BG2, anyway), so if one of your party members is paralyzed, they will commonly attack that party member to the exclusion of all else. As Hold and Stun effects commonly last for a few rounds,
            there's not much hope of them surviving a combat situation. Characters who are affected by Web also suffer being auto-hit, but because a Webbed character is allowed a Save every round, they can usually escape before they're killed. Another Save-or-Die condition is being
            Poisoned, especially in BG1: The venom delivered by Spiders, Ettercaps, and Wyverns is so lethal that almost any character who becomes Poisoned by them will die in a matter of <i>seconds</i> if he doesn't have fairly immediate access to antivenom measures.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some spells and effects deserve special mention because they can cause the <b>permanent</b> death of the victim. Effects which kill beyond resurrection are being "chunked" (whether it's through massive damage or a <font color=007700>Vorpal</font>
            hit), being Petrified and then damaged (even 1hp of damage shatters the statue into itty-bitty fragments), losing one's last few hitpoints to Cold damage (this turns the body into a statue of ice, which then shatters on its own after a few moments), or failing to Save
            against the <font color=007700>Disintegrate</font> effect. Most of these means of death destroy not only the creature's body, but also any items it was carrying, with the exception of gold and certain quest-related items. Most forms of permanent death
            can be disabled by going to your Options screen, looking under "Gameplay," and turning off Gore. The effects of Charm, Confusion, and <font color=007700>Maze</font> also deserve special mention because although their effects are not lethal (or even damaging) under normal
            circumstances, they will immediately end the game if you are playing a Solo character. Apparently this is a quirk of the game engine, something about the player not having any controllable party members.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Beware the Lightning Bolt.</b> This Level 3 spell is incredibly dangerous, to victim and caster alike, because when it hits a target, it can bounce off in some other direction, and then it goes bouncing off whatever wall(s) it touches,
            until it has traveled a total distance of 120 feet. This means, in confined areas, it can bounce back and forth, hitting the same target over & over again. Even one hit from it is very damaging, but being caught in the ricochets is just horrendous. Sadly, BG1 Mages use this
            spell pretty frequently, even in tight spaces, so they'll usually kill <i>themselves</i> with it, but they might take out a good chunk of your party as well—perhaps permanently. BioWare wised up for BG2, and made those Mages cast Lightning Bolt a lot less frequently, at
            least in indoor areas.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The counterbalance to spellcasting is Spell Disruption: If a spellcaster takes damage <i>while he is casting</i>, he usually loses his concentration, and the spell is wasted, fizzling away into the empty air with no effect. The caster must wait
            for the start of the next round to begin casting another spell, during which time he is vulnerable to being hit again, and again. This is the #1 reason why spellcasters should not be on the front line of a battle. Now, Spell Disruption does not <i>always</i> work,
            I've seen enemies take hits and still get their spells off plenty of times, but then again it's happened to my <b>benefit</b> a few times as well, so I suppose it's fair. Spells that are cast by reading them directly off a scroll cannot be disrupted by any means (other than
            the death of the caster, or the death/invisibility of the target).<br><br><br>
            
            <center><b>You have been Waylaid by Enemies, and must Defend Yourself!</b></center>
            <br><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When traveling from one map area to another, you will occasionally run into somebody else while <i>en route</i>. These encounters almost invariably end in combat; whether the meeting was one party's
            deliberate attempt to ambush the other, or simply the result of pure chance, both sides tend to assume the worst in a dog-eat-dog world. Most of the time, it can safely be assumed that you walked into a trap that your enemies laid for you, because of the relative placement of
            your party members and the various enemies: Sometimes they attack from "behind" your regular orientation (your party is in its usual Marching Formation, and your Tank is the person <i>furthest</i> from the bad guys), and sometimes you're completely surrounded. Sometimes you've
            wandered into a dead end in a box canyon or mountain cliff, and the only way
            <td width=10><td><a href=images/waylay.jpg><img src=images/twaylay.jpg alt="We were all in good health when we set out . . . Hey, don't laugh. If it happened to me, it can happen to you."></a></table>
            out is through your foes. Also, due to the time elapsed from traveling from one map area to another, any buffing spells you had active earlier are likely to have expired. As I'm sure you've guessed, Waylay combat can get pretty
            hairy, especially near the beginning of a game. It's not <u>that</u> bad, though: Most Waylay enemies are fairly low-level and not too much of a threat, the element of surprise is their only real advantage.
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The map areas on which Waylays occur are unlike regular maps in several ways: Most notably, they do not exist on the World Map (once you leave, you cannot go there again, unless another random Waylay pulls you to the exact same area), you
            cannot Rest there, and you cannot Save your game there. One Waylay area in BG1 contains a Basilisk, which I mention only because it can cause the equivalent of permanent death: Normally, if a party member gets Petrified, you can leave their statue there, go buy a Stone to
            Flesh scroll, come back, use it on them, re-recruit and heal your party member, and continue on your way. But because you cannot travel back to a Waylay map, anyone who gets Petrified there is likely going to be lost to you forever (unless you happen to be carrying a Stone to
            Flesh scroll <b>with</b> you, of course).
            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Waylay areas exhibit the kinds of environment and creatures you would find in the areas you are traveling between. This is most prevalent in BG1, where forests, mountains, plains, and arid badlands all have landscape-specific Waylay
            encounters. In BG2, there are also Waylays that take place between city areas.<br><br><br>

            </table></table></table><td width=10><td>1) Scout ahead. The reasons for this were explained thoroughly in the section on Stealth.<br>2) Stay behind your Tank. This, too, is intuitive, but it's so important that it wouldn't hurt to reinforce the message. It doesn't much
            matter if only 1 or 2 bad guys slip past the Tank, as your backup Tanks can surely handle that much, but if the enemies are smart enough to ignore the Tank <i>en masse</i> and go for your soft, tender meat instead, don't be afraid to pull your</table>back rank away from the
            fray entirely while the Tank remains in the thick of it, refocusing the enemies' attentions solely on him. Running away is almost always an option, and frequently it's a good one. If you have room to maneuver, don't be afraid to use it.
            <br>3) Kill the Mage. Spells, especially AoE and/or Save-or-Die spells, can change the course of
            a battle, very dramatically and very quickly. Therefore, it is imperative that your enemies <i>not be allowed</i> to cast any. You must neutralize enemy spellcasters by killing or incapacitating them as quickly as possible, even at the expense of ignoring other threats.
            Losing a few hitpoints is something you can handle—having half the party fail their Save against a Chaos is something you cannot.<br>4) Don't let your enemies fight they way <i><u>they</u></i> want to fight. Keep your foes at a disadvantage by playing to
            their weaknesses, not their strengths: If he's coming at you with a melee weapon, dance away and don't give him a chance to use it. If he would rather shoot you, get in his face and stay there.<br>5) Drink heavily. All characters (most especially the Tank) should carry
            Healing Potions at all times, just in case. They should drink one (or recieve a Healing spell) whenever their health falls below 50%, <b>OR</b> they are missing enough hitpoints that they would get the full benefit of the potion/spell. When in city areas, it's advisable to
            take advantage of local Temple services, thus saving your own spells and potions for when you're out in the wild and Temples aren't available.<br><br>

                describing specific items), discusses the basics of potions, wands, miscellaneous equipped items, and containers, and outlines the various facets of the Inventory screen.<br><br>

                </table><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are also armors made from the plates and scales of various insectoid and Draconic animals, and depending on their creatures of origin, these armors can have characteristics and Usabilities of almost any class of armor, from
                Leather all the way up to Plate. Because they (usually) contain little to no actual metal in their construction, they can be worn by Druids—although, curiously, not by <font color=007700>Beast Masters</font>. All of these armors are enchanted, and because they have no
                unenchanted "base" type, they cannot be included in the table above. For those armor types that <i>are</i> listed, "basic" enchantment on armor improves its base AC: Each additional level of enchantment lowers the base AC of the armor by 1 point—normal Leather has an AC of
                8, so Leather+1 would be AC 7, Leather+2 would be AC 6, etc. Enchanted armors usually have the same AC Modifiers as their base type, so a Leather+2 would be precisely 2 points better than plain Leather at stopping attacks made with each of the 4 types of weapon. "Basic"
                magical Shields follow this same pattern.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next up: Same thing, just for shields. Note that, in order to make the red "actual protection" shading easier to see, I've magnified the scale threefold, as compared to the scale used on the armor.<br>

                <center><b>Having a LOW Armor Class is GOOD.</b></center>
                I know it's counterintuitive, but in this game, the <i>lower</i> you can get your AC, the better. Drive it well into the negative range if at all possible.<br><br>
                (Nonmagical) Shields don't really improve your AC a whole lot, certainly not in comparison to armor, as they're just a handful of rather minor AC Modifiers. But your Tank would still do well to carry one, and Shields can be quite powerful once they get some enchantments
                on them.<br><br>WEAR A HELMET. (Unenchanted) Helmets won't improve your AC one bit, but every time somebody lands a Critical Hit on you, the Helmet will prevent your taking double damage from the hit.</table></table></table><br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the Newbie Note says, normal Helmets don't do a damn thing except protect you from Critical Hits, but that's still ample reason to slap one onto your noggin if you can. Classes unable to wear Helmets (<font color=007700>Monks</font>, Bards,
                Thieves, Mages, and <font color=007700>Sorcerers</font>) can wear <font color=007700>Ioun Stones</font>, which are pebble-sized stones, usually semiprecious gems, which are highly enchanted and when placed in proximity to your head, will whirl around it like a moon orbiting
                a planet. As bizarre as it seems, these little twirling rocks will deflect Critical Hits so that they only do their normal amount of damage. There are no Ioun Stones in BG1, which gives those characters who cannot wear helmets yet <i>another</i> reason to stay out of the
                front lines of a battle.<br><br>
                <b>Q: "What happens if I don't wear any armor at all?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: You get your ass handed to you.</b> Unlike some games, where going skyclad improves your ability to dodge, and unlike most fantasy art, which suggests that the power of a sorceress's
                magic is inversely proportional to the amount of clothing she has on, in BG there's absolutely no reason to go berserking into battle in the nude. The obvious exceptions are the <font color=007700>Kensai</font>, <font color=007700>Monk</font>, and<font color=007700>
                Shapeshifter</font>, who get their AC from natural sources.<br><br>
                <b>Q: "Will the same suit of armor fit any character, no matter what race they are?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: Yes.</b> In PnP, magical armor resizes itself to fit the wearer, and for the sake of convenience the BG games treat <u>all</u> armor in this fashion. So
                your Halfling can remove his Full Plate and toss it to your Half-Orc, who fits into it just fine.

                All of the red attributes listed as "Specials" are <i>beneficial</i> enhancements. You want your THAC0 to be low, and your Attacks per Round & Damage per hit to be high. All melee weapons add (or subtract) damage due to their user's high (or low) Strength, but Throwing Axes are the only weapons to do this

                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Range of 0 indicates touch-range, meaning you can only reach targets as far away as the end of your arm. Characters wielding weapons with a range of 2 (<i>i.e.</i>, any 2-handed melee weapon) are <i>just</i> able to hit enemies while standing directly behind characters
                using weapons with a Range of 1. Most of the Ranges listed for missile weapons and launchers are largely irrelevant: Almost all creatures in the game have a sight radius of 32, and you cannot target missiles (or spells) at creatures outside your own personal sight range anyway.<br><br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All weapons can be given a "basic" enchantment such as +1, +2, etc. For melee weapons, each level of enchantment grants -1 bonuses to THAC0 and Speed Factor, and a +1 bonus to damage. Crossbows and Slings likewise recieve -1 bonuses to THAC0 & Speed Factor, and +1 bonuses to
                Damage for each level of enchantment, while Bows (both Short and Long) get bonuses to THAC0 and Speed Factor, but not Damage. This pattern continues in their respective ammunition: Bolts and Bullets gain bonuses to THAC0 & Damage, whereas Arrows only get THAC0. As for magical thrown weapons, Darts get
                improvements to THAC0, Damage, & Speed Factor. Enchanted Throwing Axes also carry benefits to THAC0, Dam, & SF, and also have a maximum Range of 20. Magical Throwing Daggers are weird because they have a base damage of 2D4—double the amount inflicted by any other kind of dagger, they're really more like
                Throwing Bastard Swords—and they also have 100 Range and a Speed Factor of 1. The only things normal about magical Throwing Daggers are that each level of enchantment grants bonuses of -1 to THAC0 and +1 to Damage. Magical Throwing Axes and Throwing Daggers frequently have the enchantment of "returning,"
                which is the property of reappearing in the user's hand immediately after they are thrown. While thrown weapons that lack this property can each only be thrown once (at which point it vanishes forever), thrown weapons of Returning can be used an infinite number of times.<br><br>

                types of magical and/or extraplanar creatures are immune to Normal weapons: If you are wielding an unenchanted Long Sword against a <font color=00bb00>Fire Elemental</font>, you could roll a natural 20, a Critical Hit, but your attack still won't actually affect the creature because Elementals are
                completely immune to Normal weapons—you must use magical weapons in order to</table>harm them. A weapon's Enchantment Level is <i>usually</i> consistent with its other magical effects; <i>e.g.</i>, a Long Sword+2 strikes as a +2 weapon, carries -2 bonuses to THAC0 & Speed Factor, and a +2 bonus to Damage.
                There are exceptions to this, however, usually among weapons that are designed to be especially effective against a particular type of foe. For instance, a certain Club may grant THAC0 and Damage bonuses that make it act like a +3 Club when fighting Ogres, but when used against anyone else it behaves like
                a relatively normal Club+1. This hypothetical weapon may have an actual Enchantment Level of 3, or it may only strike as a +1 weapon. In these cases, the G3 Fixpack generally gives the weapon the higher of the two possible Enchantment Levels (in case you have to fight, say, an Ogre who's immune to +1
                weapons).<br><br>
                <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Depending on their nature, origin, and power, certain creatures may be immune to different Enchantment Levels of weapons. Creatures immune to (for example) +1 weapons are immune to Normal weapons as well, but can be struck by all weapons of +2 enchantment and above. In
                general, you should try to acquire (and use) weapons of as high an enchantment level as possible. In BG2 especially, make it a priority to ensure that each of your party's Warriors carries (and is at least Proficient in) a weapon of +3 enchantment or higher. Note that using a heavily enchanted launcher
                (such as a Bow) won't make a damn bit of difference if you've only got Normal ammunition (such as Arrows). Since the <i>ammunition</i> is what actually strikes the target, only <i>its</i> Enchantment Level factors into whether or not you can actually score a hit.
                <td width=10><td><img src=images/ineffective.gif></table><br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In BG1, <i><u>Normal weapons will break</u></i>. As the game will very thoroughly explain to you, there is an ongoing "Iron Crisis" wherein even brand-new swords can snap like twigs at the very worst of times. This affects ALL weapons that include a significant amount of
                metal: Crossbows and all melee weapons except Clubs and Staves have a 1% chance to break every time you use them. The resulting Broken Weapon you get is completely useless; Spears and Halberds do not turn into Staves when they break. Now, this happens only to <u>Normal</u> weapons; magical weapons were
                forged before the iron crisis hit, and therefore were made of good, sound steel. It is <i>extremely</i> important that all of your party members either carry spare weapons, or simply not use any breakable weapons at all. Armor, even nonmagical metal armor, is happily (but oddly) unaffected by the iron
                crisis. In BG2, the crisis is over, & Normal weapons are once again trustworthy.</table></table><br>
                <b>Q: "What happens if I don't use any weapon at all?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: You get your ass handed to you.</b> If you go into combat emptyhanded you've got three big disadvantages (none of which apply to the <font color=007700>Monk</font>):<br>
                1) You won't get the benefits (THAC0, Damage, Speed Factor, ApR, etc.) of a weapon proficiency, a weapon style, or the weapon itself.<br>2) If you're not holding a melee weapon in your on-hand, anybody using a melee weapon <i>against</i> you gets +4 bonuses to their Attack and Damage rolls.<br>
                3) You can't kill anything. Your Fist counts as a Normal weapon that only does 1D4 Stunning damage (plus a possible STR bonus), and the thing about Stunning damage is it's non-lethal: You could inflict hundreds of hitpoints of Stunning damage on somebody, and all it will do is take them down to 1hp and
                knock them Unconscious for a couple of rounds. This can actually be a benefit sometimes: Suppose some pompous Noble insults you, and you want to get even but you don't want the Reputation penalty that comes from killing an innocent? Just sheathe your sword and beat the crap out of him until your honor is
                avenged.<br><br>
                <b>Q: "My Cavalier can't use Slings, Bows, or Crossbows, so why can he carry Bullets, Arrows and Bolts?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: Because he still has a Quiver.</b> Just because he prefers to fight only in melee combat doesn't mean he can't carry a little extra ammunition for when his friends
                are running low.<br><br><hr><br>

                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before I move on to other types of items, I should explain the Inventory screen itself. On the left is the Inventory screen in BG1; click the image to change it to the BG2 version, and double-click to change back. Both screens show the same character, a Female Elven
                Mage/Thief, carrying the exact same equipment. The number inside the shield-shaped icon shows her base Armor Class of 3, the numbers inside the circular icon show her current hitpoints (51) over her maximum hitpoints (57), and the number next to the piles of coins is the amount of gold the party currently
                has.<br><br>
                <b>Quick Weapon</b> slots are a means of keeping more than one weapon ready for action. By storing them in his Quick Weapon slots, a Fighter can switch from a Spear to a Mace to a Crossbow to a Two-Handed Sword, without ever visiting the Inventory screen. Fighters have four Quick Weapons, other Warriors
                and <font color=007700>Monks</font> have three, and all other characters <i>should</i> have two. You will see that the BG1 screen only shows one Quick Weapon: This is due to the limited number of bottom-row buttons in the main game screen. Mage/Thieves need buttons for Cast Spell, Stealth, Detect Traps, and
                Thieving (and Cleric/Thieves also need <i>another</i> button for Turn Undead), meaning there's simply not enough room to display a button for a 2nd Quick Weapon. In BG2, however, that's amended, and all classes have at least 2 Quick Weapons (although Cleric/Thieves still have their Thieving button hidden
                behind their Special Abilities menu).<br><br>
                <b>Quick Items</b>, also known as Quickslots, are locations for keeping things like Potions, scrolls, and Wands ready for use, accessible from the main game screen. All classes and kits get 3 of them.</table><br>
                The 16 slots at the bottom of the screen are your <b>Backpack</b>, items that you're carrying but cannot actually <i>use</i> until you equip them somewhere on your person. (Exception: Potions can be drunk directly out of your pack. Don't ask me how you get your mouth into your backpack.) Next to the Backpack
                icon are the weight of all items you're carrying, and your total Weight Allowance.<br><br>
                
                <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
                Your <b>Quiver</b> is for storing ammunition: Arrows, Bolts and Bullets. (Thrown weapons do not go here, they are used directly from your Quick Weapon slots.) If your launcher-weapon empties one slot of ammunition, your character will stop attacking, even if he has more ammo in other Quiver slots. He will
                only start to draw ammo from another slot if you specifically tell him to Attack again, or the character is running an AI script that gives that command for you.<br><br>
                Items on the <b>Ground</b> are just that: If you kill an enemy, walk over to the pile of items it dropped, and then go to your Inventory screen, those dropped items will be visible in these slots.<br><br>
                All other slots are for equipping items that your character actually wears: Armor, Bracers/Gauntlets/Gloves, Helmet/<font color=007700>Ioun Stone</font>, Necklace, Belt, 2 slots for Rings, a Cloak, Boots, and Shield (which in BG2 is Shield/Weapon, reflecting the possibility of Dual-Wielding in that game.)

                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Both BG1 and BG2 offer an impressive array of auxiliary gear such as Potions, Wands, Scrolls, and Wand-like Items; but the different <i>physical forms</i> that these items take isn't really as important as what they <b>do</b>, and how they do it. Here is a list of how, and
                when, various magical effects are implemented.<br><br>
                <b>Equipping Effects</b> are the most common type: These effects are conferred simply by <i>wearing</i> this Helmet, that Ring, those Boots, etc., and remain in effect for as long as you keep the item equipped. The "backup" weapons in your Quick Weapon slots do not count as Equipped for this purpose; only
                the weapon you are actually <i>holding</i> with your on-hand (or your offhand as well, if you're Dual-Wielding) confers any While-Equipped Effects.<br><br>
                <b>Charge-Depletion Effects</b> are for those items with a set number of uses; Scrolls, Potions, and Wands follow this format, and some other items use it as well. When you drink a potion or cast a spell from a scroll, the item vanishes—if you drank from a stack of potions, there is now 1 fewer potion
                in that stack. Some wands can be used until they are completely out of charges; trying to use it after that point only displays the message "Item Drained." Other wands will destroy themselves upon expending their last charge. Both types can be recharged, by selling them to a store and buying them
                back. (Wands placed in your Quickslots will display how many charges they have left in BG2, but not in BG1; you may want to offer to sell the wand to a merchant, and consult the "Wand Prices in BG1" table in Appendix 1.) To use a Charge-Depletion item, either click on its Quickslot icon, or click your
                "Use Item" bottom-row button & then select the item you want to use.<br><br>
                <b>On-Hit Effects</b> are seen only on weapons and ammunition, and fire whenever they strike an opponent, doing things like adding some amount of Elemental Damage to the regular amount of Physical damage that they inflict upon the victim, or forcing the creature to Save vs. Death or be Nauseated for 3
                rounds, etc.<br><br>
                <b>Use-per-Day Effects</b> are an implementation seen only in BG2, and allow items to cast spells (sometimes spells unique to that particular item) a certain number of times each "day." Once the daily charges have been used up, the item remains in place (and any Equipping Effects it may have will still
                function normally), but the spell(s) cannot be used again until the party Rests, at which point the item's charges are fully refreshed. This implementation is common for Wand-like items (items carried in Quickslots but that are not technically Wands), but is frequently seen on equipped items as well.
                These items are used in the same manner as Charge-Depletion items.<br><br>
                <b>Backlash Effects</b> are also BG2-only, and occur only rarely even there. They fire when you are wearing/using an item with said backlash effect, and you are hit with a weapon or spell targeted directly at you—usually by an opponent standing within melee range. The Backlash is so named because it most
                often takes the form of retaliatory damage against your assailant, but it could just as easily have some effect that targets <i>your</i> character instead.</table><br>
                Those are the <i>forms</i> that enchantments can take—what the enchantments can <b>do</b> is another matter, and one about which I'm not going to get very specific, at least on this page. I will tell you, however, that the variety is huge, and many times will force you to stop and consider your options:
                Is it better to use the Bow that has a 10% chance to Blind the victim on every hit, with no Saving Throw, or the Morning Star that forces its victim to Save vs. Wands or have take a +2 THAC0 penalty? Should you use the Amulet that wards off Charm spells or the Belt that grants Free Action, and why
                can't you wear both? These are the kinds of questions you will have to face: Deciding <u>what</u> items will be used by <u>which</u> party members <u>when</u> is a major part of your job as the leader of the party.<br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <i>order</i> in which you equip items can be important: Some effects/items will <b>set</b> some statistic (such as THAC0 or Save vs. Breath Weapon), while other effects/items will <b>alter</b> that statistic. Suppose you have a Helmet that grants 30% Slashing Damage
                Resistance while equipped, and a Ring that confers +15% Slashing Resistance while equipped. So if you put on the Helm & then the Ring, you'll have 45% Slashing Resistance. Equip the Ring before the Helm, however, and you'll only have 30%. Now, there's a weirdness with <i>weapons</i> that have Equipping Effects,
                which is that those effects are <b>re</b>-applied nearly every time you use the weapon to attack. So if that "Slashing Resistance = 30%" item were a Spear instead of a Helmet, you could equip the Spear before the Ring to get 45%, but then after whacking some dude you're back down to 30%.<br><br>
                
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One special type of item is <b>Keys</b> (and key-like objects such as wardstones). There are a few of them in some regions of TotSC, and many more scattered throughout BG2. Keys typically allow you to open certain specific doors and chests that can <b>only</b> be opened by using
                <i>that</i> key. Other keys will allow access to certain places by granting immunity to some nasty affect that occurs whenever somebody is trying to reach that place, etc. It is pretty common for Keys to vanish out of your Backpack after being used; Keys that remain in place are usually used more than once,
                so you should probably play it safe (at least on your first game) and store them somewhere, in case you ever need them again.<br><br>
                
                <table align=center cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor=white><tr><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1 bordercolor=ff8800 bgcolor=ffffff><tr><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>Two very notable types of items are Items of Protection and Cursed Items.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Items of Protection</b> are very useful, providing a boost to your AC and Saving Throws at the same time. I mention them specifically because, according to PnP rules (and therefore in BG as well), you cannot equip more than one
                of them at a time: The enchantments somehow interfere with each other, etc., similar to the way that you can't wear more than one Ring on each hand. Items of Protection also conflict with all forms of enchanted armor except Mage Robes: You will have to choose between
                <td width=10><td><img src=images/newbie.jpg></table>wearing your Plate+2 and having a
                better AC, or wearing your unenchanted Plate and enjoying the Saving Throw bonus granted by your Item of Protection.
                <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Cursed Items</b> can be very dangerous. Not only do they carry strong negative enchantments, but they <u>cannot be removed</u> normally: Part of their effect is to enchant the wearer so that he does not WANT to remove them, in fact he'd rather die than put them down.
                Clerics, Wizards, and Temples all have access to the spell of Remove Curse, which can be cast on a party member carrying a Cursed item, giving them a moment of mental clarity long enough to see the Cursed item for what it is, and drop it like a hot rock. This does NOT remove the item's harmful
                enchantments, or the "bind-to-user" effect: If you equip the item again, even on the very same character who just dropped it, it will once again be glued to them. <i><b>Any</b></i> item that is not yet Identified is potentially a Cursed item, so use Unidentified items at your own risk.</table></table><br>
                
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are certain things that can cause the permanent destruction of items, which can be quite a downer when you learn that some enemy was carrying some fabulous weapon or whatever, but you didn't get it because your method of killing him also destroyed everything he was carrying.
                A creature's body (and everything on it) will be shattered by: Losing one's last few hitpoints to Cold damage, being Petrified and then taking damage, or being <font color=007700>Disintegrated</font>. Only gold, and certain specific quest items, are exempt from being destroyed. You will also not recieve any
                loot if you trap a foe with an <font color=007700>Imprisonment</font> spell: The items are still being carried by the enemy, who is technically still alive.<br>

                <b>Q: "This item in my Inventory is shaded red. What does that mean?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: It means you can't use it.</b> Either because your basic stats (usually Strength) are insufficient, or you're of a class / kit / alignment / race that isn't allowed to use the item. If an item is
                shaded <i>blue</i>, however, that means that the item is magical, and Unidentified.<br><br>

It has absolutely no purpose in the
                game, but at least it's worth a couple of bucks. Just don't ask me <i>why</i> anyone would pay good money for it.<br><br>

                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>A: That depends on which game you're in.</b> If you're still in the SoA portion of BG2, those are just there for flavor: Apparently somebody thought it would be more realistic to have the physical evidence of your enemies drinking potions in combat, just like you do, but then
                they only implemented this idea for one solitary fight. The empty bottles are useless, ignore them. Then again, if you've progressed all the way to ToB, that empty bottle is indeed used for something, in fact it's impossible to continue down the Main Plot without it. Hold on to it.<br><br>
                
                <b>Q: "So . . . where can I stash my stuff?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: In any Container(s) you want.</b> Items (except certain specific "quest" items) left lying on the ground will disappear after about 24 hours, but objects placed in containers such as chests, barrels, crates, etc., will stay
                there forever. So just find a nice unoccupied spot (possibly one that <i>used</i> to be occupied until you killed everybody) and move in. Be <u>sure</u> to avoid leaving wanted items in areas to which you will be unable to return, and in areas where the map can change: If you leave items in the <i>old</i>
                map area and then the game shifts to the <i>new</i> map area, the containers in the new area will not let you access the items you placed in the old ones. Don't worry, I indicate all of the "you can't go back here" areas and "this map might change" areas in Chapter 9.<br><br>
                
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Speaking of storing items, one entirely new type of item introduced in BG2 is <b>Containers</b>, which are carried in your Backpack and can hold a limited amount of items of a certain type: SoA includes a number of <font color=007700>Scroll Cases</font> and 
                <font color=007700>Gem Bags</font>, which are quite handy in keeping large numbers of spell scrolls and gems/jewelry from overflowing your entire Backpack. ToB brings us a <font color=0000ee>Potion Case</font> and <font color=0000ee>Ammo Belt</font> (which is still carried in your Backpack, not actually
                worn as a Belt) as well. Another convenience tweak offered in BG2 is doubling the amount of (most types of) ammunition that can be stored in a single Inventory slot. You may have noticed that in both Inventory screenshots above, the character was carrying 120 Arrows, but in BG1 only 60 of them would fit in
                her Quiver, the rest had to go down in her Backpack.<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Magic spells can be very powerful things, quite often determining the outcome of a battle, and some encounters consist of nothing <b>but</b> spells. Magic is fairly simple and easy to understand in BG1, but once you hit BG2 there is considerable increase in both the number and variety of available spells, especially for Wizards.
                    This chapter should help you make sense out of things and figure out why your Warriors just can't seem to kill that Mage. The exact specifics of spells aren't listed here, this chapter is more about general knowledge of spells, what they do, and how (not) to use them. The only way to <u>truly</u> understand spells is to understand the workings of each
                    individual spell (and for that, you'll want to consult the Spell Dictionary in Appendix 1), but for the purposes of an overview, this chapter will suffice.</table>
                    
                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The most important distinction between spells is the various reasons for casting them, what purposes they serve in (or out of) battle. The basic types are:
                    <b>Damaging.</b> These spells' primary function is to kill the enemy, to burn away its (or their) hitpoints until there are none remaining.<br>
                    <b>Healing.</b> Just the opposite of Damage spells, these restore hitpoints and heal wounds, whether they were caused by a weapon or spell.<br>
                    <b>Summoning.</b> These spells call forth a wide creatures, both from the Prime Material and other Planes of existence, to aid the caster in vanquishing his foes.<br>
                    <b>Buffing.</b> There are two major types of buffs: Those that increase <i>offensive</i> abilities of the target(s), and those that boost their <i>defensive</i> abilities. Buffs can be cast during battle, but they are usually cast beforehand (if possible).<br>
                    <b>Incapacitating.</b> Spells that, while doing no direct <u>harm</u> to an enemy, still removes him from the fight, by reducing or even eliminating his ability to contribute to it.<br>
                    <b>Spell-storage.</b> These spells allow Wizards to preserve some of their unused spells to be used later用erhaps in a few minutes, perhaps several days down the road.<br>
                    <b>Anti-Protections.</b> Some Buffing spells are powerful Combat Protections that shield from physical attacks, others are Spell Protections that guard against magical threats. The sole purpose of Anti-Protection spells is to counteract and remove these spells, and of course there are Spell Protection spells that block certain Anti-Protections, and there
                    are Anti-Protections to bypass <i>those</i> Spell Protections, and so on, in an arcane arms-race.<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not all spells fit these basic types, in fact many very important ones don't match these categories. But this is enough of a framework for now.<br>
                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The second most important thing about a spell is its target: The creature or creatures that it can effect.<br>
                    <b>Self-targeted.</b> These spells affect the caster and no one else: Almost all of these are buffing spells, in one form or another.<br>
                    <b>Touch spells.</b> These spells target one, and only one, other creature, which must be close enough for the caster to touch with his empty hand. Almost all Healing spells follow this pattern (though healing spells can also be targeted on their own caster). There are also offensive Touch spells, most of which require the caster to first cast the spell,
                    then walk up to the enemy and make a melee hit on the first try.<br>
                    <b>Single-target.</b> These spells (usually of a Damaging, Incapacitating, or Anti-Protection nature) affect one creature, which can be anywhere in the caster's field of vision.<br>
                    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
                    <b>Area-of-Effect.</b> Arguably the most useful type, these spells affect <i>all</i> creatures that are within the area selected by the caster and as predetermined by the "projectile" that the specific spell uses. There are many projectiles, each affecting a different area. The most common is a circle with a radius of 30 feet: Spells like Fireball will
                    damage all creatures standing within 30' of the target point, which can be any creature or patch of open ground within the caster's sight range. Other spells have the same 30' radius, but the caster does not get to choose the central point: The caster IS the center of the spell. Other examples include <font color=007700>Cone of Cold</font>, which uses a
                    projectile of a wedge approximately 120 degrees wide and 25 feet long, erupting directly from the caster. The spell Aganazzar's Scorcher creates a line of fire that connects the caster with his victim and remains there for two rounds擁f either creature moves, so does the burning jet of fire. Aganazzar's is technically a single-target spell, but because
                    of the (possibly) moving line of flame, it also has an area of effect. Some AoE spells can be cast on open ground, while others require a (visible) creature to serve as the target.

                    When casting spells while there are ANY creatures other than your party and enemies nearby, make <u>sure</u> you know whether or not those spells are party-friendly. You could wind up killing Innocents and screwing your Reputation, you could turn quest-related people Hostile to you and thus be unable to finish that quest, and you could make your own
                    Summons turn on you: Even if you hit a Summoned creature with a form of damage to which it is immune (such as catching one of your own <font color=00bb00>Fire Elementals</font> in the blast radius of your Fireball), it will still read that as an attack, and change allegiance to be Hostile to you.</table></table><td width=10><td>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last (and in some ways the most important) consideration is whether or not the spell is <b>party-friendly</b>; that is, does it affect <i>only</i> creatures that are Hostile to the party, and can you cast it without fear of harming creatures that are Neutral (such as innocent bystanders if you're in a town) or even Allied
                    (such as your own party members and Summons). One spell that is party-friendly in every way is <font color=007700>Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting</font>, which can do some severe damage to all creatures in a 30' radius . . . but <i>only</i> if those creatures are openly Hostile to you. It doesn't matter how many innocents are within the area of effect, the spell
                    won't touch one hair on their pretty little heads. If you had cast a Cloudkill at the exact same spot, however, every single Commoner in that area would be dead. In a middle ground between those two extremes are most of the Incapacitating spells, such as Stinking Cloud: It's not party-friendly, because it affects all creatures within the area of effect, but
                    you can still cast it with Innocents about because it doesn't cause actual <u>harm</u>: After the spell expires, all the Commoners caught in the fumes will get back up and go about their business, apparently not minding that you just enveloped them in a cloud of nauseous vapors that made them deposit their breakfasts all over the floor.</table><br><hr><br>
                    
                    <center><b>Spell Effects</b></center><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Chapter 6, I mentioned that items can have a buttload of fancy-dancy effects on them耀pells can do everything items can do, and more, because a big reason that the flashiest items are so flashy is <u>because</u> they cast spells. Just about any stat, from the most basic ones like Strength all the way down to the amount of
                    damage you do on any particular hit, can be altered with spells and their effects. There are spells that put enemies to sleep, that turn creatures to stone, that allow creatures to heal by taking Elemental damage, that send enemies to other planes of existence, that call forth angels and demons to fight on your behalf, even spells that stop time itself. As
                    I said, I won't be going over specific spells here; instead, I'll just give a run-down of several common effects and what they do, so that when you encounter them in-game, you'll know what they mean.<blockquote>
                    <b>Blindness:</b> Blinded creatures have a sight range of 0 (you can see as far as the end of your arm), and take +4 penalties to their THAC0 and AC. Because you cannot target creatures you cannot see, you have to walk right up to them in order to fire spells or ranged weapons at them.<br>
                    <b>Charm:</b> The affected creature becomes a devoted and faithful servant of whoever Charmed him, even if he had been violently opposed to them a moment before. Charmed creatures will typically attack their former comrades without mercy, until the duration of the Charm wears off.<br>
                    <b>Confusion:</b> For the duration of the effect, Confused creatures will erratically switch between wandering in a random direction, attacking whatever creatures happen to be nearby, and standing around doing nothing.<br>
                    <b>Deafness:</b> Just as speech is required for spellcasting, apparently you need to be able to <i>hear</i> what you're doing as well: Deafened creatures suffer a 50% chance of Spell Failure (cumulative with other sources) for as long as the Deafness remains in effect.<br>
                    <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td width=795>
                    <b>Fear:</b> There are three types of Morale Failure, and when achieved through magical spells the most common result is Morale Failure: Panic, in which the affected creatures alternate between running for their lives and randomly attacking whatever creatures happen to be nearby. Regardless of the type of Fear, all affected creatures remain uncontrollable
                    for the Fear's duration. One thing I have noticed, at least in BG1, is that creatures under Fear still retain their basic, default AI洋eaning, if anyone attacks them, they will fight back. So even if your entire party succumbs to Fear, there's a good chance that your panicked party members will still attack the bad guys anyway.<br>
                    <td width=10><td><a href=images/azrael.jpg><img src=images/tazrael.jpg alt="Screenshot by Dundee Slaytern"></a></table>
                    <b>Infravision:</b> An almost-completely useless condition that makes warm-blooded creatures appear to have a faint red glow in dark lighting conditions. It does not allow one to see invisible creatures. All playable races except for Halflings and Humans have permanent Infravision.<br>
                    <b>Invisibility:</b> Invisible creatures cannot be seen, attacked, or have spells or abilities targeted directly at them (except by certain creatures who can see the invisible) until the effect wears off, the Invisibility is removed (by a Thief's <font color=007700>Detect Illusions</font> or any of several Divination spells), or the Invisible creature breaks
                    the invisibility by making a successful attack or casting an offensive spell. Creatures under <font color=007700>Improved Invisibility</font> may break the invisibility and can then be attacked, but are still not a valid target for spells.<br>
                    <b>Hold / Stun:</b> Held creatures are locked rigidly in place by means of a wall of magical force that envelops them completely: They can breathe, and possibly move their eyes, but are completely immobile. The wall does not protect them from physical attacks made by other creatures. Stun, on the other hand, attacks the motor control centers in the victim's 
                    brain, causing them to temporarily forget how to move. Both effects cause the affected creatures to become sitting ducks: All attacks made against them automatically hit. The state of Free Action provides immunity to Hold (as well as Slow and Haste), but is inconsistent with regard to Stun: Some sources of Free Action protect against Stun, others do not.<br>
                    <b>Luck:</b> This effect places a modifer (usually positive) on all dice rolls made by the affected character: To-Hit rolls, damage rolls, and Saving Throws are all affected, as well as Thieving skill checks. I am unsure if a Mage's odds of scribing a spell, or hitpoint rolls upon Leveling Up, are adjusted.<br>
                    <b>Miscast Magic / Spell Failure:</b> Creatures under this effect have a chance to spontaneously fail casting spells as long as the effect is in place, with the percent chance of failure determined by the strength of the Miscast Magic effect. (As a player, you have no way of knowing exactly what your odds of Spell Failure really are, only that you have 
                    <u>some</u> chance of screwing up.)<br>
                    <b>Silence / Vocalize:</b> As almost all spells require certain words to be spoken, creatures who are Silenced are effectively prevented from casting spells. The one spell that can be cast while Silenced is Vocalize, which removes the need to actually speak the magic incantations, and therefore both counteracts the existing Silence spell and grants immunity
                    to being Silenced again. The Silence effect only prevents speech, not noise; casting it on your Thief will not improve his <font color=007700>Move Silently</font> skill.<br>
                    <b>Slow / Haste:</b> Slowed creatures move at half their normal speed, take a +2 penalty to their Speed Factor, and suffer +4 penalties to their THAC0 and AC. Hasted creatures, conversely, have a doubled Movement Rate, get a -2 Speed Factor bonus, and gain an additional attack per round. The Slow effect will Slow a creature that was previously Hasted, and
                    vice versa. There is also the condition of <font color=007700>Improved Haste</font>, which instead of granting +1 Attacks per Round, actually <i>doubles</i> the affected creature's ApR. It also doubles the rate of time-based effects such as Poison and Regeneration: If an Improved Hasted character is hit with an effect that causes him to take 4 Poison damage
                    per round, he will instead take 8 damage per round.<br>
                    <b>Regeneration:</b> Depending on the specific settings used in the Regeneration opcode, this effect will heal affected creatures of a certain amount of lost hitpoints either every round, or every second, until the duration of the effect expires.<br>
                    <b>Resistances:</b> Elemental Resistances are far more common than Physical ones (at least when granted by spells), but Physical ones are just as possible. Most creatures have 0% Resistance, of course, and if you have 100% Resistance to a particular element, you take no damage from it whatsoever. You can even raise your Resistance <i>above</i> 100%, at which
                    point you will actually <u>heal</u> from taking damage of that type. The maximum possible resistance to anything is 127%, and the lowest known is -25%. Even if you are immune to an element, however, you will still "flinch" when being hit by it; even if the damage actually heals you, the "flinch" can interrupt your spellcasting, so be careful. Note that some
                    spells will <u>set</u> Elemental (or other) Resistances, while other spells will <u>add</u> to them. If you're going to be combining 2 or more spells that affect the same stat, be sure you know whether
                    
                    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=700>
                    or not the effects are cumulative, and what order you should be casting them in.<br>
                    <b>Unconsciousness:</b> Creatures under this effect fall to the ground and cannot move for the duration of the effect, whatever that might be. Because the sleeping creatures cannot move, all attacks made against them automatically hit葉he game doesn't even bother rolling the die to see if the attack was successful. (Which means, paradoxically, that
                    you can't get a Critical Hit on an Unconscious enemy.)<br>
                    <b>Dispel Magic:</b> All of the effects listed above can, in most circumstances, be Dispelled葉hat is, terminated prematurely via a spell or effect that causes all (Dispellable) active enchantments affecting a creature to immediately cease. Most temporary effects caused by a spell or potion can usually be Dispelled, as opposed to the more permanent Equipping
                    Effects caused by wearing certain items, which almost always cannot be Dispelled. Some sources of effects such as Blindness and Deafness are treated as undispellable, but even then
                    
                    <td width=10><td><a href=images/soaspells.jpg><img src=images/tsoaspells.jpg alt="A gratuitous display of power."></table>
                    
                    they will respond to spells such as Cure Disease, or at least <font color=007700>Restoration</font>. In BG1, Dispel Magic had the effect of instantly dissipating <u>all</u>
                    dispellable enchantments, no matter what. In BG2, however, the odds of a successful Dispel are dependent on the levels of the person A, who cast the original spell/effect, and person B, who is trying to dispel it. The in-game description of the Dispel Magic spell accurately explains how the spell was <i>intended</i> to work, but there is an unfortunate
                    <font color=cc0000>bug</font> in the actual implementation. When Caster B is of a level
                    
                    equal to or greater than Caster A, the spell works as intended: The odds of a successful Dispel are 50% + (B's level - A's level)%. But when a <u>lower</u>-level caster tries to dispel magic that was placed by a <u>higher</u>-level caster, the odds of a succesful Dispel are virtually zero. To my knowledge, this has not yet been corrected in the  Fixpack. The
                    effects below (almost always) cannot be Dispelled.<br>
                    
                    <b>Death Magic:</b> As opposed to "death by losing all your hitpoints," death magic instantly snuffs out the entire life force of the affected creature. Some (rare) forms of Death Magic do not take effect immediately; rather, the party member simply gets a portrait icon that says "Dying" (it looks somewhat like a white cobra), and one round later, they will
                    <b>die beyond Resurrection.</b> As far as I know, all instances of this latter effect only occur in BG1, and can be Dispelled during the 1-round grace period.
                    <br><b><font color=007700>Disintegrate</font>:</b> Creatures affected by this, and any objects they are carrying, crumble into dust用ermanently.<br>
                    <b>Fatigue:</b> Although Fatigue is almost always caused solely as a result of characters being awake for a long time, it can sometimes be caused by magical means as well; for example, the spell Haste causes as much Fatigue as approximately 16 hours of marching, and <font color=007700>Restoration</font> spells simulate having been up for a whole day. Fatigue
                    works like the opposite of Luck, imposing penalties on all of your die rolls: Hit and Damage rolls and Thieving skills are known to be adversely affected, and Saving Throws might be as well. These penalties increase the longer you stay up past your bedtime.<br>
                    <b><font color=007700>Level Drain</font>:</b> Depending on the level of the creature causing the effect, from 1 to 5 Experience Levels are "drained" from the victim, reducing their hitpoints, THAC0, Saving Throws, spellslots, and Thieving skills accordingly. (Even if only one level is drained, a Dual- or Multi-classed character will lose 1 level from both/all
                    of his classes.) The affected creature is unable to get his lost levels back by earning more EXP. This condition is <i>permanent</i> until the victim recieves a <font color=007700>Restoration</font> spell.<br>
                    <b><font color=007700>Maze</font>:</b> This effect sends the affected creature to another plane of existence, a plane which consists solely of a gigantic labyrinth. How long they remain there depends on random chance and their Intelligence: The smarter they are, the more quickly they can find an exit.<br>
                    <b><font color=007700>Imprisonment</font>:</b> Like Maze, this too sends the target to another plane, but unlike Maze, the duration is practically infinite. The affected creature is sealed into a tiny sub-plane no larger than the creature itself, where it remains locked in suspended animation until the spell <font color=007700>Freedom</font> is cast in the
                    area from which the creature was Imprisoned. Party members who get Petrified are effectively booted from the party: Even if you free and re-recruit them, they will act as if you intentionally kicked them out of the party, and have their feelings hurt accordingly. In BG2, the party may control only 5 Summoned creatures at any one time, and if one of your
                    Summons gets Imprisoned, it will continue to remain alive預nd count against your Summon
                    
                    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=800>limit蓉ntil it is freed.<br><b>Petrification:</b> This effect essentially kills its target, instantly turning them to stone right where they stand. If the resulting "statue" takes any kind of damage, it will immediately shatter, killing the Petrified creature permanently. (Flying creatures who are Petrified
                    in midair do not come crashing down to earth.) Petrified creatures can be restored by casting Stone to Flesh on them, which brings them back to life with only 1 hitpoint. Like Imprisonment, this effect also makes party members think that they have been cast out from the party.<td width=10><td><a href=images/squirrel.jpg>
                    <img src=images/tsquirrel.jpg alt="See, not even Petrification spells use the Petrify/Polymorph Saving Throw. Screenshot by Dundee Slaytern."></a></table>
                    
                    <b>Poison:</b> Creatures who are Poisoned will take a certain amount of damage either every second, or every round, depending on the specific settings used on the Poison opcode. Note that Poison damage and the condition of <i>being</i> Poisoned are two completely different things, and immunity to one does not necessarily mean immunity to the other.<br>
                    <b>Disease:</b> This effect is like Poison in that it can inflict extended damage over time, except that it uses (I believe) Magic damage, not Poison damage, and it can also cause Slow and penalties to your basic stats (like Strength and Constitution).<br></blockquote>
                    
                    <hr><br><center><b>Somebody cast a spell at me!</b></center><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When a spell hits you, the game goes through a cascade of checks for your spell defenses, both natural and otherwise. Let's say you're a Level 14 Wizard Slayer, holding a Staff that grants 30% Electrical Resistance, and a Level 12 Mage casts a Lightning Bolt at you. To figure out how much damage you should take from the lightning
                    (if any), the game runs through these checks, in the following order:<br>
                    
                    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=center><ol>
                    <li><b>Magic Resistance.</b> Your MR is a percent value that indicates the likelihood of your being hit by (or caught in the Area of Effect of) a spell, and suffering no effect from it whatsoever. In BG1, MR could stop <u>all</u> spells: Even Healing spells cast by your fellow party members could be Resisted. In BG2, however, only damaging or harmful spells
                    can be blocked by Magic Resistance. You have 14% Magic Resistance, and the game rolls a D100 to see if the spell is blocked. The roll is a 61葉he Lightning Bolt penetrates your Magic Resistance, and the game goes on to the next step.
                    <li><b>Spell immunities.</b> There are several forms of these: Actual <font color=007700>Spell Immunity</font> would make you immune to Lightning Bolt (and all other Evocation spells) if you had cast it and selected the Evocation school. But you didn't. If you were immune to spells of Level 3 and lower (either naturally, or through a spell such as Minor Globe
                    of Invulnerability), then that would also block the Lightning Bolt. If you were protected by an active <font color=007700>Spell Deflection</font> or <font color=007700>Spell Turning</font>, that would be another chance to render you immune, or even bounce the Lightning Bolt directly back at the Mage who cast it. Also, if you were under an Illusionary
                    protection such as Mirror Image, there would be a chance that the bolt of lightning would strike one of your decoys instead of you, saving you from the hit. Lastly, you could be immune to the specific spell of Lightning Bolt. But as none of these conditions are true, the game goes on the next step.
                    <li><b>Saving Throws.</b> A Lightning Bolt fired by a Level 12 caster deals 10D6 Electrical damage, with a Save vs. Spells for half, to every creature that it hits. You automatically take 5D6 Electrical damage, and are allowed a Saving Throw to avoid the other 5D6. Your Save vs. Spells is 8, and you roll a 14, successfully making the Save.
                    <li><b>Physical / Elemental Resistances.</b> 5D6 damage can be anywhere from 5 to 30 damage; in this case, the roll of the dice comes out to be 21. Because you have 30% Electrical Resistance, that 21 gets reduced to 15: You take 15 Electrical damage.
                    <td width=10><td width=345><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1 bordercolor=ff8800 bgcolor=ffffff><tr><td><center><img src=images/newbie.jpg></center>
                    <center><b>Having LOW Saving Throws is GOOD.</b></center>
                    I know it's counterintuitive, but in this game, the <i>lower</i> you can get your Saving Throws, the better. Drive them well into the negative range if at all possible.<br><br>
                    There are five Saving Throws: vs. Death, vs. Breath Weapon, vs. Wands, vs. Polymorph, and vs. Spells. Only the Death and Spells Saves are actually important, however: The other three Saves are checked <b><i>very</i></b> rarely.<br><br>
                    Anyway, when rolling a Save, the game checks two numbers: One is your (or the target's) personal Save score, and the other is a roll of 1D20. If the die roll is <i>equal to or higher than</i> the target's personal Save value, the target has successfully rolled the Save. The lower your personal Saving Throws are, the easier it will be for the die roll to be
                    higher than them.

                    If you're up against low-level archers, the spell Protection from Normal Missiles would fit the bill very nicely, granting you complete immunity for quite a long time. If your enemies prefer to melee, <font color=007700>Protection from Normal Weapons</font> and the <font color=007700>Mantle
                    </font>spells can make you immune to weapons of up to +3 enchantment, at least for a short time. For a (possibly) longer-lasting safeguard, <font color=007700>Stoneskins</font> will completely absorb <u>all</u> of the Physical damage inflicted by the next (up to) 10 successful attacks against you熔nly the weapon itself is blocked, though, any on-hit effects
                    that the weapon might have will still get through. Finally, the big daddy of combat protections, <font color=007700>Protection from Magical Weapons</font>, will render you briefly invulnerable to ALL weapons except Normal ones. PfMW may not be stacked with PfNW or either of the Mantle spells, but it <u>can</u> be stacked with Protection from Normal Missiles,
                    and it also may be cast by creatures who are naturally immune to Normal weapons洋aking those creatures briefly untouchable by ANY weapons whatsoever.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Q: "This high-level spellcaster is kicking my ass! What should I do?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: That's what high-level spellcasters do.</b>
                    In BG1, Mages (at least pureclassed Mages) are almost more of a dead weight to the party than anything else, but in BG2 they become powerhouses, at least for brief fights預nd as <i>all</i> fights are brief (at least from the enemy's point of view, as they only have to win ONE battle,
                    whereas your party has to win dozens of fights per day), Wizards in BG2 can be extremely dangerous opponents.<br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This chapter gives brief descriptions of the behavior and notable qualities of most types of creatures you are likely to encounter in the game—most of which will try to kill you. Not <b>all</b> potential enemies are listed here, and I try not to reveal <b>too</b> much about certain creatures, because in some cases that would be too much like telling you precisely how to defeat them. This list is confined to <u>racial</u> traits & behavior, so creatures defined primarily by their
                        character <u>class</u> (such as Thief or Mage) are omitted. Creatures are listed here in <i>roughly</i> their order of difficulty, from easiest to most difficult. While BG2 was designed and built on the rules of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, it does not always adhere to the canon lore of AD&D, especially when the source material itself changes from edition to edition (BG is mostly a mish-mash of Editions 2.0 and 3.5). In areas where BG and canon AD&D disagree, I tell things the way you're likely to encounter them in-game.

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These creatures, though completely unrelated, are usually grouped together because of their small size and their shared status of "roadkill" enemies: In general, you'll steamroll right over them almost without even noticing. Only Kobolds and Goblins carry ranged weapons, and Gibberlings use no weapons at all, as they're little more than feral beasts. All of them live (and hunt) in groups. Packs of Kobolds are sometimes supplemented by a Shaman or other low-level spellcaster. All types can be encountered in just about any terrain, although Gibberlings, Xvarts, and especially Tasloi prefer to live in forests, grasslands, and hilly areas, while Kobolds and Goblins more frequently dwell underground.</table>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Despite being roadkill for most of the game(s), Kobolds can be a significant threat in the early stages of BG1, especially when they're using their Bows: 5 Kobolds together means a 50% chance that they'll score a Critical Hit on somebody, and when you're only Level 1 or 2 a single Crit will cost you a significant chunk of hp. There are also Kobold Commandos, who are slightly tougher than regular Kobolds and shoot Arrows of Fire, which again can be especially deadly against low-level party members.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lowest tier of Undead, both types are always found in groups. Zombies never carry weapons and move rather slowly; they never even resemble a danger to you. Skeletons are sometimes unarmed, but usually carry a combination of both ranged & melee weapons—due to their "transparent" body shape, they are fairly resistant to Missile & Piercing attacks. They'll get in the lucky hit now & then, but otherwise aren't much of a hazard.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wild animals foraging for survival—Dogs and Wolves commonly hunt in packs (though a lone Wolf is not unknown), and will attack you on sight. Bears, however, usually prefer to live and let live, turning hostile only if you enter their cave (if they have one), or if you get to close to them while out in the open—and even then they tend to stay pacified if they can see an Elf, Druid, or Ranger. Bears come in many varieties, from the relatively unimpressive Black Bears to the ferocious Mountain Bears, which are also resistant to the cold weather of their chosen habitat. Types of Wolf are even more numerous: Of particular note are the Winter Wolves, which possess a breath weapon that allows them to project a blast of cold air capable of hitting a target a considerable distance away, and the especially dangerous Vampiric</table>
                        Wolves: Not only are they immune to Normal weapons, but they also heal themselves with every successful attack they make on an enemy—and each bite has a chance to Hold that enemy as well.<br><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Living puddles of gelatinous goo, these creatures typically live in dark, moist environments, oozing along the ground & filtering out food particles. They come in many varieties, all of which move slowly, have a ranged attack (a small chunk of their own flesh, spat out at you), and are immune to Backstab (because they have neither any vital organs nor any "back"). They are also resistant to Missile and Piercing damage. The only two types of note both pose a significant threat, especially in BG1: Mustard Jellies are immune to Normal weapons, as well as all Piercing/Missile attacks, and have extremely high Magic Resistance to boot. Their attacks are quite potent, causing both Slow and Disease in the victim. Green Slimes are even more dangerous: While otherwise unremarkable, their attacks force the victim to Save vs. Death or (after a delay of 1 round) suddenly <b>die beyond Resurrection</b>.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These Undead are unusual in that they are not animated into Undeath by another being, but rather attain it through "natural" means: Any intelligent creature who voluntarily engaged in cannibalism can, after death and some decomposition, rise again as a Ghoul, a bloated, distorted corpse that waddles around, looking and smelling horrible. Individuals who died shortly after (or sometimes even during) an act of cannibalism will become a Ghast, more powerful than others of his type. Both kinds feed solely on meat, freshly killed if they can get it, if not they act as scavengers. Their only strength is in their melee attacks: Each hit can Hold the victim, while those in melee combat with Ghasts must also endure their horrible stench (<i>i.e.</i>, Save vs. Breath Weapon) or become Nauseated. They can be encountered in just about any type of terrain, and either singly or in groups, depending entirely on the number of former cannibals who died or were buried nearby.

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These are bizarre grubs/maggots swollen to gigantic size, presumably through magical means. They are easy enough targets for a party with enough skill at ranged weapons, but they may cause trouble if they get in melee range, as each hit can Hold the victim. Happily, their little mandibles do very small amounts of damage, so even if a party member gets Held, he may have enough hp to stay alive while his friends kill the Carrion Crawler munching on him. CCs commonly live in groups, favoring humid areas.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Both of these species speak (their own languages as well as Common), make their own homes, clothing & tools, and have a culture—Orcs even have their own pantheon of gods. Of course, both races' cultures are based on war and conquest, so it's not unusual for adventurers to find themselves at odds with them. Most members of these species become Warriors and use both ranged and melee weapons, but they still won't pose much of a threat to you; even Hobgoblin Elites, who dip each arrow in a weak Poison before firing it, are a relatively easy kill. In BG2, the presence of both species is augmented somewhat by the addition of spell-casting Shamans. The vast majority of individuals of both races are Evil, but as in most cases there are exceptions.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They do speak, and make rudimentary attempts at weapons, clothing, and culture, but these tall, lanky beasts with dog-like heads are still only a couple of steps above animal intelligence & behavior. They live and hunt in packs, fighting among themselves almost as much as against others. Flinds are larger and darker-furred than Gnolls; in PnP, their favored weapon is a "Flindbar," a 3-section staff with which they try to entrap an opponent's weapon and yank it out of his hand. This occurs in-game only to some extent: BioWare decided not to implement actual weapon droppage, but when in melee combat with a Flind, you will still occasionally see yourself make a Save vs. Wands. Both groups shun the use of ranged weapons.</table><br>
                        
                        <b>Spiders</b><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=40><td>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are many types of Spiders, most of which have a Poisonous bite that ranges in potency from "dangerous" to "spectacularly lethal." Most spiders move slowly, meaning you can usually shoot them down before they can close to melee, but there are 3 exceptions: Sword Spiders are physically the most dangerous combatants—they move at double speed and attack twice as rapidly—but happily, they are nonpoisonous. Phase Spiders have the bizarre ability to Dimension Door at will: Upon seeing an enemy, they prefer DDing to his location, rather than walking. They may randomly decide to DD two or three times during a fight, sometimes right into your back rank where they could eat your Mage. Lastly, "Baby" Spiders are physically the weakest type there is, but they move quickly, and curiously have the most potent venom.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spiders prefer to live in groups, either underground or in heavily wooded areas. All Spiders are immune to the effects of Web.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The origin of Ettercaps is somewhat unclear; externally they have many spider-like characteristics, but possess a basically humanoid skeleton and musculature, so a popular theory is that they were the product of mages (possibly Drow) creating a crossbreed between humanoids and spiders, for the purposes of experimentation, punishment, or perhaps even entertainment.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Regardless, Ettercaps are Evil and quite intelligent, although this is only evident in the facts that they can speak Common, they act as leaders for the communities of Spiders in which they tend to live, and they are quite skilled at placing Web traps for enemies to blunder into. Ettercaps have no ranged attacks and are unspectacular melee fighters, but they do have poisonous fangs, and are immune to Web. They are usually found singly or in pairs, although they will band together into small groups if they see an opportunity to take a larger prize.<td width=10><td><a href=images/ettercap.jpg><img src=images/tettercap.jpg alt="Art by Wayne Reynolds"></a></table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ogres and their kin (Half-Ogres are half Human, Orogs are half Orc) are respectable, even formidable melee combatants in BG1, but pretty much fall by the wayside in BG2. Although fairly intelligent, Ogrekin never use ranged weapons, but Ogre-Magi do cast a few low-level spells. Ogres can be found either on their own or in small groups—either way, they are best handled with caution. Just as with Orcs & Hobgoblins, most of these creatures are Evil.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These small, winged, superficially reptilian creatures come from the Elemental Planes, as well as from smaller sub-planes where the larger ones merge. For instance, an Air Mephit naturally comes from the Plane of Air, while a Smoke Mephit hails from the mid-zone between the Planes of Air and Fire, and an Ooze Mephit was created in the merging of the Planes of Water and Earth. Regardless, Mephits can be pretty annoying; they're hardly ever a real threat and can be killed fairly easily, but not before they hit you with an unavoidable spell/attack concordant with their element/plane of origin.</table><br>

They are smart enough to recognize faces and discern friend from foe, and therefore are not  infrequently kept as useful additions to large complexes such as castles, prisons, and even public buildings: Not only do they function as something of a living sewer, but they are vigilant watchdogs as well, attacking intruders while allowing authorized persons to pass unmolested. In the wild, they prefer to inhabit caves and live as scavengers, and are sometimes found in a semi-feral state, roaming the sewage systems of major cities.</table><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td width=40><td>

Their thick skin is usually encrusted with the filth in which they prefer to live, and is highly resistant to missile weapons. In combat terms, they are rather unimpressive—a fact of which they are aware, and therefore will usually attack only in self-defense, if they are see prey that is alone and/or already injured, or of course if they have been trained to do so. Their attacks are most notable for causing disease, as an open wound inflicted with a weapon covered in dung pretty much means automatic infection. Few installations are large enough to merit the digestive capacities of more than one Otyugh, so they are usually encountered alone.</table><br>

Their main form of attack, a glob of highly acidic saliva, is just as dangerous at range as their powerful bite. These creatures are very dangerous for a low-level BG1 party, but once you have a few levels under your belts you should be able to handle them fairly easily, and in BG2 they're little more than scenery. One unusual trait of Ankhegs is that they're invisible while moving from place to place: They're burrowing underground and you can see them only when they emerge to fight.</table><td width=10><td><a href=images/ankheg.jpg><img src=images/tankheg.jpg alt="Art by Tom Baxa"></a></table><br>

They are generally neutral in alignment and tend to be so in their behavior as well, but some may have been so angered by the destructive influences of civilization that they will attack trespassers on sight. When combative, they fight with Bows and spells (avoiding Evocation spells, as these harm the environment), and a kiss from one of these beauties can be either an attack or a way of Charming the recipient into wanting to follow the Faerie's every command.</table><br>

In combination with their intelligence and very keen eye for detail, they can use this ability to take on the exact likeness—in face, build, and voice—of any person they have met long enough for a casual conversation. In general, their purposes are not exactly nefarious, but they are always on the lookout for their own self-interests, and so are not infrequently employed as spies and assassins.</table><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td width=40><td>

Communication is performed via individuals scattering some of their telepathic spores on nearby creatures. Old Myconids lose the power of movement and put all their energies into producing spores, which germinate in fertile ground and grow into new Myconids. They prefer working for the benefit of their colony to any warlike action, rising to hostility only when the colony itself is entered by an outsider, or when a friend or ally is directly threatened. In combat, they fight with their fists, although they also use their spores as a weapon, hurling them at an enemy who is then likely to become Confused by the many conflicting voices in his head.</table><br>

But the resulting species is highly intelligent (they have their own language, religion, and even architecture) and quite dangerous: Their culture is an evil, unceasingly violent one that pits them against the Sea Elves, their oceanic rivals, and their pantheon of gods demands constant living sacrifice—Sahuagin frequently raid coastal settlements to capture land humanoids for sacrifices when they can't get Sea Elves. Sahuagin have a sharklike trunk, including fearsomely-toothed jaws and a powerful tail, but also arms and legs, which are webbed for swimming but can also grasp the Spear and Crossbow, their favored weapons.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sahuagin tend to attack in small groups, sometimes supplemented by a low-level spellcaster. Most are fairly lackluster combatants, at least against experienced adventuring parties—their greatest advantage is probably the special stunning Paralytic Bolts that only they can make, and which come in very handy when they want to capture (but not kill) humanoids for sacrifice. Some Sahuagin are quite formidable fighters, but usually only those of the nobility can reach these levels of skill.</table><br>

They are human-sized and roughly humanoid <i>amphibians</i>, not fish, and they too favor the Spear and Crossbow, and make their own type of crossbow Bolt that can Stun the victim. They are probably less intelligent than Sahuagin, but they too have their own gods. They prefer to live underground—both underneath land and bodies of water. They are less physically violent than Sahuagin, but they make up for it by having more abundant and more powerful spellcasters: Kou-Toans typically move in small groups, most of which contain both a Priest and a Wizard. One unique feature of the Kou-Toans is that the entire species can see invisible creatures: With eyes adapted to centuries of living in near-total darkness as well as their highly-developed senses of smell and hearing, they are able to detect almost literally <i>any</i> movement or other sign of life.</table><br>

It was during this period that they gradually acquired their psionic abilities; after centuries of enslavement, they managed to stage a revolt and kill off the majority of the Illithids. They might have exterminated the race completely, except that a schism of philosophy emerged among the Gith, and a sect broke off and became the Githzerai—the two groups are now rivals.

Some do emulate them by gathering "treasure," but this is typically anything shiny carried by creatures they have killed. They live in heavily forested areas, preying on just about any type of animal they can find, commonly taking them by surprise by diving from above. They usually occur singly, in mating pairs, or a mother with her brood of hatchlings.

As enemies, their normal combat stats are not particularly intimidating; it's the additional effects of their attacks that make them dangerous. Shadows have a melee attack that temporarily saps the victim's strength, Shadow Fiends can cause Hold with their hits, and both Wraiths and Wights have a touch that inflicts Level Drain.

At this point, they <u>can</u> actually be killed, but only by the application of something that can damage the Troll's body faster than the Troll can heal itself—the only things known to have this quality are acid and fire, though happily, even a small amount of either one is usually enough to slay the beast completely.

They use neither clothing nor tools, and what buildings they do erect are usually no more than crude huts. Their primary interests appear to be eating and fighting. There are many varieties of troll, living in habitats varying from mountaintops to deserts to the open sea, so they can be encountered practically anywhere. Trolls are humanoid, with rather spindly limbs attached to a hunched, blob-like torso. Most are about six feet tall, but would be closer to nine feet if they stood up straight, which they almost never do.<br>

They can move quite rapidly, and attack (which they do with little to no provocation) by lashing out with their arms and body. Some varieties can create clouds of poisonous or other types of gases, seemingly by erupting them from their own body, and other varieties have an attack that Level Drains the victim. Two types of Mists, the Nishruu and its more powerful cousin the Hakeashar, are well-known to wizards: These creatures seem to <u>eat</u> magic, and love attacking arcane spellcasters for the express purpose of draining their spellslots—each melee hit from either of these creatures will cause a memorized spell to become un-memorized, as if the wizard had cast it.</table><br>

These Stalkers are usually summoned for the purposes of acting as assassins or spies, although of course they will also act on their own accord if they or their interests are threatened. Divination spells and techniques are nearly useless against Invisible Stalkers, as their transparency is completely natural—these spells reveal only the creature's outline, or at best a cloud of mist.

The three elements which have the greatest in-game presence are Air, Earth, and Fire . . . Water is almost completely ignored.

Creatures with at least 50% demonic blood are called Cambions (of which the females are sometimes called Alu-Fiends), while those whose fiendish ancestry accounts for <i>less</i> than half of their genetic makeup are known as Tieflings—strictly speaking, this term applies only to part-Human offspring (Elven, Dwarven, Orcish, and even Halfling versions exist, whose fiend-hybrids are called Fey'ri, Maeluth, Tanarruks, and Wisplings, respectively), though it can also be used as a blanket term for part-demonic creatures, regardless of their ancestral race on the Prime.<br>

These may include horns, tails, cloven hooves for feet, and/or strangely-colored eyes, skin, or hair. Even though most Tieflings are not Evil in alignment, these physical reminders of their ancestry are impossible to ignore, so they are frequently mistrusted and outcast from society. Both Tieflings and Cambions carry some of the powers of their fiendish heritage, and the strength of these powers tends to be in proportion to their genetic makeup.

Drow spend most of their lives deep underground, in the Underdark, but almost all of them ascend to the open air at least once in their lives, in order to kill and enslave members of surfacer races—this is called a "Blooding" and is a common rite of passage among their evil kind. Bloodings almost always take place at night, both because surfacers tend to be asleep at that time and the subterranean Drow are very accustomed to darkness (while daylight burns their eyes), and also because Drow are renowned for the armor and weapons they make out of the alloy known as adamantine, which is stronger yet more flexible than almost any other material—but which also crumbles into dust when exposed to direct sunlight. One of their most powerful traits, however, is the innate Magic Resistance that all Drow possess . . . most have around 50-60% MR, although this tends to fade away among Drow that leave the Underdark for extended periods of time (which almost never happens).</table><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><a href=images/drow.jpg><img src=images/tdrow.jpg alt="Art by Todd Lockwood"></a><td width=10><td>

Their culture is strongly matriarchal—only female Drow may assume positions of power, and males can achieve social status only by being useful to the females of his House. All Drow learn a few basic magic spells, usually harnessing the powers of the Underdark in which they live. Apart from these simple cantrips, only female Drow become Priests and only males become Wizards, though both genders train as Warriors.

(As the "animal" in question is most commonly a wolf, that's what I'll be discussing.) Werewolves and Wolfweres are frequently mistaken for one another, but are actually quite different: Werewolves are individual Humans who have the power to take a wolf-like or wolfman-like shape (or upon whom the shape sometimes manifests itself, regardless of the Human's wishes), while Wolfweres are an entire species of creatures that were once Wolves, but somewhere down the line aquired the ability to take a man-like or wolfman-like shape. All Werewolves become so by being bitten by another Werewolf, thus passing on the "curse" of lycanthropy—no record of an "original" Werewolf is preserved. The origin of Wolfweres is similarly unclear; they might have been created by some mad Wizard, or possibly by a Werewolf biting or mating with a Wolf while in wolf form. Suspended halfway between the two races are the Loup Garou, the offspring of a Werewolf and a Wolfwere. These creatures seem to be able to shift from Human to Wolf form, and any point in between, at will, and combine all the wit and skill of their human lineage with the instinct and cunning of their lupine ancestors.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Regardless of origin, all lycanthropes are dangerous foes, especially when in their heavily muscled wolfman forms.

They much prefer to attack at close range, however, as only by clawing and biting their victim can they feed upon his blood and Level Drain him—the combat abilities of a Vampire depend greatly on each individual's status, but even a Fledgling has a fair chance of defeating a target unprotected from Level Drain, by weakening him to the point that he can no longer fight back. Also depending on their status, Vampires can only be struck by weapons of +1, +2, or sometimes even +3 enchantment, or of course better. Another self-defense tactic they sometimes exhibit is the ability to retreat from a losing battle by turning into a bat or cloud of mist and flying away, before their enemy can actually land the killing blow. The story about needing to drive a wooden stake through their heart to actually destroy them is also true, but only for especially high-ranking Vampires.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Although they are reknowned as masters of shapechanging and illusion magics, a Rakshasa's natural form is very similar to a Human's, with the notable differences that their heads look exactly like those of adult tigers, their entire bodies are furred and colored like a tiger's, and their hands curl in precisely the opposite direction—when they hold their hands flat out in front of them with their thumbs together, their palms face <b>up</b>. Rakshasa society is practically based on pride and arrogance: Their species does have a nobility and other leaders, but these are scarcely more than nominal titles, because all Rakshasa detest the idea of taking orders from anyone else, including one of their own. Most are not happy unless they are the undisputed leader of something . . . thanks to their very keen minds, they do well in this role. Rakshasa are very ambitious and self-serving, however, and will consent to serve another being—temporarily—if the reward is great enough or the Rakshasa can fool its "master" by taking advantage of a loophole of which the master was unaware. Their pride, evil nature, and carnivorous diet lead them to prefer wearing nothing but the very finest of Human fashions, and eating nothing but the flesh of intelligent creatures (usually Humans) prepared by master chefs.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rakshasa are skilled sorcerers and very competent swordsmen, although they typically disdain to actually cross blades with a lesser creature, preferring instead to crush their foes with magic. Rakshasa are immune to all low-level and mid-level spells, and delight in flaunting this power by casting area-of-effect spells directly on themselves, laughing while all those around them suffer.</table><br>

They retain all the physical-combat abilities they had in life, and boast some additional demonic powers as well, such as being able to breathe fire and instill fear in their enemies, and cause Level Drain with a mere touch. They act as loyal servants and guardians for the being who created them, usually acting as their captain, supervising the rest of their master's minions.

Many Fiends also heal themselves during combat by draining health from their foes. Powerful Fiends are typically considerably larger than a Human, and most have six limbs: Two arms, two legs, and either two wings or another pair of arms, plus a tail and of course a head. Glabrezus sport a nasty pair of pincer-like claws on each of their upper arms, which are notable as they are capable of inflicting Vorpal hits, while Mariliths are serpentine, moving about using only their tail, a means of locomotion that frees all 6 of their arms to hold weapons.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Despite their vast power and secretive nature, much is known about Illithids (colloquially named Mind Flayers), presumably through descriptions given by their escaped former slaves, who likely would want all other races to learn as much as possible about the Illithids' strengths and weaknesses. Legend has it that the Illithids originally came from a world beyond the planes, if such a place could even exist, and soon after arriving upon Toril, they quickly began subjugating and enslaving other intelligent beings. The revolt of the Githyanki broke their power, driving them into scattered lairs deep underground, from where they plan the re-conquest of the world. Illithids abhor sunlight, but they are not Undead but fully living creatures, and their life cycle is well documented. Each Illithid begins life as one of many tadpoles spawned by an adult; after several years of</table><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=40><td>
                        swimming in the same tank of vitreous fluid as the Elder Brain (literally, a huge living cerebrum that serves and controls its Illithid colony) and basking in its psionic influence, the tadpole is given a host—a member of any intelligent humanoid race, ranging in size from Halfling to Gnoll. After the host is physically restrained, the tadpole is inserted into the host's eye, nose or ear, from where it burrows into and feeds upon its host's brain. The tadpole then expands to fill the braincase, and grows eyes, a spinal cord, and a digestive tract that all replace the host's own, and allows its flesh to grow out through the mouth and all the way around to cover the entire head. It also grows a ring of 4 tentacles that ring the Illithid's new mouth (which now has sharp teeth, even if the original host did not), and the creature is now an adult, looking like an octopus "riding" atop the body of its humanoid host, which has remained alive through the entire process, and will probably continue to live for many years to come. Slain or very elderly Illithids have their brains carefully removed and placed in the tank with the Elder Brain, where they merge with the entity and thus gain a kind of immortality. Illithids dine on nothing but brain tissue, and vastly prefer those of intelligent beings, as they can absorb a portion of their meal's thoughts and memories. Each Illithid colony usually keeps a stable of various types of intelligent creatures, breeding them in captivity as well as staging infrequent surface raids for more. Even those whose bodily forms make them unfit to serve as hosts for young Illithids (such as Umber Hulks) are still valued slaves, serving the colony both as workers and as eventual food.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Illithids are irredeemably Evil, incredibly intelligent (probably the most intelligent race on Toril), and endowed with very strong powers of psionics. Their most feared is a blast of mind energy that can stun any intelligent creature within a large radius into complete immobility for several rounds. Their combat stats are unimpressive, but still extremely deadly, as each hit from one of their tentacles temporarily deactivates a significant part of the victim's brain. It usually takes only 2 to 4 hits (in relatively quick succession) before all 4 tentacles are able to latch onto the victim's head, at which point the Illithid is able to crack the victim's skull like an egg and lift out their entire brain, causing instant death. As if their psionics did not make the species dangerous enough, Illithids' vast mental capacities make learning arcane magic child's play for them. Still, the practice of magic seems to be discouraged by Illithid society, so few decide to become Wizards . . . although those who <u>do</u> typically become exceedingly skilled at it, even turning themselves into Liches, at which point they are called Alhoons, and are figures of great respect. All Illithids, whether they study magic or not, typically develop a moderate resistance to its effects.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In PnP, Illithids are able to sense (and read) the minds of any intelligent creature that comes anywhere near them, so attempting to decieve or hide from them is absolutely futile. This particular trait was not implemented in BG2.</table><br>

Very few of these varieties are willing to coexist with one another: Apart from wishing to exterminate all forms of non-Beholder life, most Beholderkin even seek to wipe out their cousin races for being genetically impure. They are almost always extremely evil—the closest thing to a "neutral" Beholder is the extremely rare Spectator<td width=10><td><a href=images/beholder.jpg><img src=images/tbeholder.jpg alt="Art by Scott Fischer"></a></table><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=40><td>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Regardless of subtype, all Beholderkin follow the same basic body shape: A large, round orb dominated by a large, Cyclopean eye in the center of its "face," and a mouth filled with sharp teeth directly below. 4 to 18 fleshy stalks grow out of the body, with each stalk terminating in a single, much smaller eye. The whole creature floats, apparently through magical means, a few feet above the ground. Some Beholder types have smooth, rubbery skin with snakelike eyestalks, while others have large, chitinous plates and stalks that are jointed like the limbs of arthropods. Beholderkin are carnivorous, and are able to dine on just about any creature because of the feature that makes the race as a whole so terrifying: Beholderkin are able to shoot spell-like abilities (such as blasts of fire or lightning, rays that mimic Charm and Hold spells, rays that drain life from a victim and heal the Beholder, etc) from each of their eyestalks—each eye can cast a single type of "spell"—literally <b>at will</b>, with no "casting" time or limits on how many times each ability can be used. The central eye fires a spell as well; in true Beholders, this is an Anti-Magic Ray that essentially means inevitable doom for enemy spellcasters: It instantly tears down and dispels any active enchantments currently on them, and also completely removes their ability to cast any spells for about 1 turn. Due to the fact that their many eyes are almost constantly scanning in all directions at once, all Beholderkin are immune to Backstab.</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many types of creatures, even extremely long-lived species such as Elves, bemoan what they see as their short lifespans, and seek ways to extend them. Powerful spellcasters, however, have the means to actually <b>do</b> something about it. Most Liches are archmages capable of casting even the highest levels of spells, and thus have the power and control to cause themselves to die, and then re-animate a short time later. Naturally, this draws very heavily on necromantic magics, so many Liches are former Necromancers—although Lichdom can also be attained by mages of other stripes, as well as Cleric/Mages and pure Clerics, and perhaps even through non-magical means by exceptionally strong Psionicists, although the means for these latter classes to become Liches are still rather unknown. Liches retain the memories and personality they had in life, and can be of any alignment—although due</table>
                        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td width=40><td>to the demands of the transfiguration process, the clear majority of them are Evil. The most common motive for attaining Lichdom is virtual immortality, coupled with freedom from the demands of a living body (such as sleeping), meaning the Lich is able to concentrate like never before on pursuing avenues of magical study. Liches also act as guardians/advisors for great houses (frequently their own relatives) or even small cities, or like all Undead they can also serve as sentinels, dedicating their undeath to protect or imprison powerful artifacts or other beings. As Liches can see invisible creatures perfectly clearly, they excel in this function.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Regardless of the method of or intent for becoming a Lich, the resulting form is invariably extremely powerful: In addition to retaining all the abilities they had in life (which were already very formidable), Liches can be struck only by magical weapons, can easily detect all invisible beings, and display typical Undead traits such as being immune to Cold damage and poisons. Most notable, however, is the fact that they are completely immune to all low-level and most mid-level spells: These spells, when cast by another creature, will simply have no effect whatsoever on a Lich, which makes them extremely difficult to defeat . . . and even defeating them is almost never enough to actually <u>kill</u> them, because one effect of the Lich transformation is that their souls are no longer contained within their physical bodies. Instead, each Lich transfers his soul to a phylactery, which can be any object, though most phylacteries are small, covered in ornate runes of warding, and of course made of extremely durable materials. Phylacteries may kept (either concealed or guarded) many miles away from the Lich, although they are usually in a place where the Lich can easily check on their safety. A defeated Lich will retreat to his phylactery for a time, and then either reconstruct his sorely bashed and broken physical form, or slowly generate an entirely new one if he has to. (Even bodies "regenerated" in this manner take on the same appearance the Lich had upon re-animation, namely a skeleton covered with half-rotted flesh.) To truly kill a Lich, one must destroy both its physical body and its phylactery—destroying the phylactery itself would theoretically do the trick, but Liches are usually able to teleport directly to wherever their phylactery might be, if they sense it is in danger.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A still more terrifying creature is the Demilich, which is a Lich so old and powerful that it transcends even Lichdom, and its soul is freed of all physcial constraints, including its phylactery. A Demilich commonly wanders the Planes without hindrance, seeking ever-greater knowledge and power, therefore spending much of its time in the realms of various gods and not troubling the Prime with its presence. Its physical body is left behind and abandoned, and its decay, suspended upon first becoming a Lich, resumes, until nothing is left of the Lich except some fragment of the skeleton, usually the skull. Whether or not Demiliches can be killed while astrally projecting themselves across the planes is unknown, but what is known is that they will fiercely defend their skulls. According to the few reports of those who have witnessed a Demilich in combat and lived to tell the tale, they can be struck only by weapons very high enchantment, and have demonstrated an immunity to extremely powerful spells, including 9th-level spells. In addition to their already-awesome feats of magic, they also have two spells that they are apparently able to cast <b>at will</b>: Demilich Howl, which can cause instant death to anyone standing nearby, and Trap the Soul, which can imprison single creatures inside miniature sub-planes, the gateways to which are seemingly located inside each of the Demilich's teeth (which, by this point, have usually been replaced with magical gemstones somewhere down the line).</table><br>

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dragons are creatures of such legendary might that I don't even have to describe them for you—you already know. Certain details with which you may be unfamiliar, however, are as follows: Dragons engaged in combat with much smaller opponents (such as Human-sized adventurers) frequently use their gigantic wings to create sudden sweeping gusts of wind that can knock these opponents clean off their feet and blow them a good distance away, dealing some considerable damage to them in the process. While it is generally wisest to fight a Dragon from as great a distance as possible (if, indeed, one absolutely <u>must</u> fight a Dragon at all), keeping that distance can be very difficult to maintain, as their large size and long legs enable them to cross battlefields quite quickly. Much can be determined<td width=10><td><a href=images/dragon.jpg><img src=images/tdragon.jpg alt="Art by Sam Wood"></a></table><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=40><td>
                        about a Dragon from merely a quick glance at them, as the color, texture, and albedo of their scales are a fairly reliable indicator of each individual's subspecies. Dragons whose scales are shiny and metallic are almost always Good in alignment, whereas those with relatively nonreflective, strongly-hued scales are Evil, and those whose hides glitter like jewels are the Neutral—and rare—Gem Dragons. Regardless of whether they are Metallic, Chromatic, or Gem, few Dragons will attack on sight (unless, of course, they want to), as they prefer to give other creatures a chance to prostrate themselves, beg for mercy, or otherwise stroke the Dragon's already-sizable ego. Most Dragons are affiated with an element, and will have a Breath Weapon that deals that type of elemental damage while the Dragon itself is highly resistant, usually even immune, to damage of that type. The power of a Dragon is a direct function of its age; hatchlings are of course nearly helpless, barely able to kill a single sheep unaided, but those of 1000 years of age or older are wyrms of titanic power indeed. Dragons possess very keen eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell, so any attempt to escape their wrath through stealth or invisibility would be a lost cause. They are immune to backstab for the same reason—and because most Dragons carry their vital targets so far off the ground that you couldn't reach them anyway. As they age, all Dragons gradually become attuned to the Weave, and gain the ability to cast a few low- and mid-level spells as natural abilities, as well as slowly building up a resistance to harmful magics cast at them. They can also study spellcasting just as humanoid mages do, and some even reach archmage status—a Dragon that manages to turn itself into a Lich is known as a Dracolich.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All Dragons keep lairs, as a rule very secure places—sometimes abandoned fortresses or temples built by other races, but more frequently they are natural caverns or structures of the Dragon's own design. Dragons almost always hunt and travel alone, but as they keep a mating partner for very extended periods of time (sometimes even for life), it is possible to encounter two at once if you venture into their lair. Almost all Dragons gather treasure, sometimes great hoards of it, usually as a physical reminder of their own self-importance, although they are not averse to spending their wealth in exchange for things that bring them equal glory, such as employing an army of conquest or donating certain priceless items at the Temple of Io, the nine-faceted god of all Dragonkind. One ability that many Dragons attain is that of shapeshifting, and those that do sometimes take the form of humanoid creatures in order to blend in and visit their society—sometimes for the purpose of acquiring a certain valuable item to add to their hoard, sometimes to revenge a slight that may have occurred decades before, or sometimes for simple curiosity.<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many types of Draconic creatures exist, such as Wyverns, Dragon Turtles, Elemental Drakes, and Landwyrms. Most of these lack breath weapons, several classes of them are wingless, and they are usually less intelligent than true Dragons. While true Dragons are of all alignments, almost all of the lesser creatures of Dragonkind are either Neutral or Evil—mostly Evil.</table><br>

                            <li>The 'Fog of War' doesn't always work properly in areas with narrow passageways, sometimes obscuring them when it's not supposed to. If you think there's more space to be explored, but you can't see how to get there, send
                            somebody to go stand in every corner of every room, and this will disperse the Fog.
                            <li>An awful lot of people have trouble finding Dynaheir, even when they've searched the place thoroughly. Again, the Fog of War is at fault. When exploring the area, just <i>looking</i> there is not enough—you actually have
                            to <i>go</i> there. If your mouse pointer says you can walk there, try walking there.
                            <li>Unless you've Saved your game recently, do not use your PC to initiate conversation with Shoal the Nereid.
                            <li>The Antichickenator spell seems to have a 50% failure rate. So don't get discouraged if it does—it's probably not a result of anything you did wrong, just plain bad luck.
                            <li>If you find yourself in an underground maze filled with Kobolds, do not leave your Mage unguarded: That place has a very fast respawn rate, and more Kobolds are always ready to appear from around the corner.
                            <li>Follow the notes, listen to what people tell you, and read your Journal.
                            <li>The start of Chapter 4 is triggered in exactly the same way Chapter 3 was: By opening a guarded chest and taking (and reading) the important papers inside.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Chapter 4:</b><br>
                            <li>You must talk to Aldeth Sashenstar during Chapter 4 if you want to talk to him at all. If you save him until Chapter 5, he'll act like you were rude to him and refuse to have anything to do with you.
                            <li>There is a particularly nasty Waylay here that annoys the heck out of me: You're facing dangerous enemies, you're in a lousy starting position, and you have about one second to position your men before the bad guys are in
                            your face. If you get Waylaid between areas made accessible in Chapter 4, let me remind you that running away is almost always an option—sometimes your best option.
                            <li>Even if you completed Coran's quest properly, he'll still remind you that you haven't finished it yet. This was evidently a low-priority bug that they never got around to fixing. Don't worry, Coran won't leave your party
                            because of it (provided you did it right, of course)—he'll just keep bugging you every once in a while. Ignore it.
                            <li>The conditions for starting Chapter 5 are somewhat nebulous. Sometimes it will trigger the instant you defeat the "boss" of Chapter 4, sometimes it waits a little longer. If you have a) Beaten the boss, b) Opened the
                            boss's chests and read the documents inside, and c) Used the "Key to River Plug," Chapter 5 should <i>definitely</i> have started. If you're still in Chapter 4, however, then you have a <font color=cc0000>bug</font> and
                            should Reload to a Saved game that you made <u>before</u> encountering the boss.

                            <li>You can <u>finally</u> enter the city of Baldur's Gate. But you'll have to cross a bridge to do so, and halfway across you'll meet a man who will ask if you were "responsible for the fiasco at the Nashkel Mines." I don't
                            know why BioWare had him use the word "fiasco," it's very confusing. What he really <i><b>means</b></i> to say is "Are you the ones responsible for entering the Nashkel Mines and discovering what was going on there?"

                            <li>The entryway into Baldur's Gate itself is somewhat difficult to see. Follow the road: It leads directly to an archway that you can't see until you've already walked beneath it. Once you're inside the wall, click on the
                            west edge of the map to Travel into the first map of BG City proper.

                            <li>All the houses in BG City that are falling into disrepair are just because BioWare didn't feel like making an interior for every single building on the map . . . and I don't blame them.
                            <li>The staff at the Helm & Cloak Inn don't like any rough stuff in their establishment—if you <u>must</u> get into a fight there, make sure none of your party members accidentally kill an innocent bystander.

                            <li>The gateway to the TotSC areas is the town of Ulgoth's Beard; to get there, go to the east side of Wyrm's Crossing (that's the name of the bridge to BG City) and head north. In Ulgoth's Beard are two Mages who each want
                            to send you to an island: I would advise against going on Shandalar's island until your party is at least Level 6, and Mendas's island until your party is at least Level 7. Also in Ulgoth's Beard are a few people who will
                            talk to you about Durlag's Tower. Durlag's Tower can actually be visited before/without going to Ulgoth's Beard, but I would advise against going there until your party is at least Level 7.
                            <li>The islands that Shandalar and Mendas want to send you to share the following characteristics: There are no shops, inns, or temples on either of them, and once you go there, you cannot return to the rest of the world
                            until you've fully beaten the entire quest. This means two things: 1) If any party members die on the island, you'll have to beat the quest without them, and 2) If there's anything you'll need, you're going to have to
                            carry it with you. May I suggest a buttload of Healing Potions? After you get back, when looking at the World Map, avoid Traveling to either of the two small islands just south of BG City: This will send you back to one
                            of the TotSC islands, with no way to get back to the rest of the world. The fact that you can Travel back to them at all is certainly an oversight.
                            <li>On one of the islands, there are a bunch of little quests given by the townsfolk, but the main quest is given by Kaishas. When you return, wrap up the sub-quests first, as the villagers will forget about them when you
                            report back to Kaishas. If Kaishas mentions a curse, and you're concerned about it possibly having any permanent negative effects on you, don't worry—it won't. Also, if you find yourself at a loss as to what to do, try
                            examining the mast.
                            <li>You'll know it's too soon to go to Durlag's Tower if you get chopped to pieces before you can even approach the entrance. Once you're inside, go upstairs first. If you think it's tough, you're not ready for the
                            underground levels.
                            <li>One reassuring note in Durlag's is that the challenges and puzzles (if any) of each floor can be completed <u>on that floor</u>, so you don't need to go running up & down staircases to see if <i>this</i> item or
                            <i>that</i> item is what you need. (Exception: Someone on the top floor gives you a quest that you may want to take the stairs to complete.) Also, things that you do on one floor will not affect any of the other floors.
                            <li>On Durlag's -2 (meaning two floors below ground level), you will find 2 pieces of an item. To repair the item, you'll need to take the pieces to a forge and weld them back together. Keep a sharp eye out for the "Use
                            This Device"  mouse pointer.
                            <li>To enter Durlag's -3, you will need a certain Wardstone, dropped by one of the enemies on Durlag's -2. This particular part is a bit <font color=cc0000>buggy</font>: Sometimes the enemy doesn't drop the wardstone,
                            sometimes he doesn't appear at all. To be on the safe side, you should probably make an archive Savegame (under a different filename) soon after entering Durlag's -2.
                            <li>Some doors on Durlag's -3 are opened by using specific Wardstones, and they will close by themselves every once in a while. It can kinda suck to discover that the doors are closed, and you left their respective
                            Wardstones on the <i>other</i> side of them.
                            <li>The conditions for leaving Durlag's -4 can be <font color=cc0000>buggy</font>. Make a backup Save after you find some talking stone heads, and before going down any of the 4 hallways.
                            <li>On Durlag's -6 is door there that can only be opened by a certain person—to get him to open it, you must be teleported to a round room, <b>three times</b>. There are 3 things that
                            can send you to that room (once each): You'll speak to one of them, and the other two are pieces of furniture: When you mouse over them, your mouse pointer will turn into the "Cast Spell Here" pointer.<br><br><hr><br>

                            <li>The game begins underground, and once you emerge into open air, you cannot return to the underground area, so you should try not to leave anything important behind. When you go down a metal staircase and come to a
                            bridge made of rope & wooden planks, you're practically at the exit.
                            <li>You will also be unable to re-enter Kalah's palace, so, again, don't leave anything important there.
                            <li>In BG1, you may have developed the habit of, upon entering a new map area, completely exploring it and defeating all (potential) enemies, before moving on to the next area. That strategy will not work so well in BG2.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Chapter 2:</b>
                            <li>There are some quests that, depending on circumstances and what class(es) your character is, will cause the map to change. Leaving important items, or recruitable party members, in these areas is a bad idea, because if
                            you leave them in the old area, which then changes to the new one, you will never again be able to go back to them. The list of areas that can
                            change is as follows: The Five Flagons Inn, any Shadow Thief Guildhall, the de'Arnisse Keep, the Temple Ruins, the Ranger Cabin in the Umar Hills, and the main & lower areas of crypts in the
                            Graveyard District. Do not leave any important items or recuitable NPCs in any of these areas, at least until <i>after</i> they've changed, and/or you have learned what causes the areas to change from one map to the other.
                            <li><font color=cc0000>Railroad Plot:</font> Unless you have been <i>specifically instructed</i> to do so, killing any Shadow Thief inside (or just outside) any of their guildhalls will result in your immediate and
                            practically certain death.
                            <li>There's a certain curse that can be put on one of the NPCs. After the curse has been broken, the party member tells you that she should be back to normal after a full night's rest. Actually, it's the passing of 24
                            full hours that does the trick, whether you Rest or not.
                            <li>If you find or discover something that the police should know about, try the Council of Six building in the Government District. Local law enforcement is run by Chief Inspector Brega.
                            <li>Normally, when you show an item to Cromwell, he'll tell you if he can upgrade it or not. But there's a specific weapon that can be upgraded with the addition of a certain metal, and even if you have the weapon while
                            Cromwell's rooting through your bags, he won't mention it at all—you need to have the <u>metal</u> in your possession for him to notice anything.
                            <li>In the Temple Ruins, there is a statue of a woman with folded arms. If you examine it, you get the message "This statue appears to be waiting for something to be placed in her arms." You can, in fact, give her objects
                            to hold (her arms are a container where you can put stuff), but a few people have said that the objects they put there promptly vanished, which can be a real bummer. So I'd advise against putting anything there—unless you
                            have a good reason to, I suppose.
                            <li>Your investigations of activities in the Bridge District will eventually lead you to a dead end, in that the person(s) you were seeking managed to get away. This is not a bug, and you (probably) didn't bungle the
                            quest, that's simply the way it goes. By the way, the Mage who Dimension Doored away before you could get his autograph was named <i>Vellin Dahn</i>.
                            <li>If you take Lord Jierdan Firkraag's quest and go to the Windspear Hills, soon after you arrive you will meet a man named Garren, who encourages you to visit his home. I suggest you do so: The area has a plot to it,
                            and if you don't enter Garren's house, you won't get the background story and you could get muddled. Note that entering his house runs a dialogue that makes the party Rest, so select tomorrow's spells before you go in.
                            <li>The town of Trademeet is actually suffering from <u>two</u> problems—save yourself some time & frustration by not trying to solve the first one until you've learned what the other one is.
                            <li>If a woman named Valen tells you her mistress wants to meet you, know that you will have to decide whether you want to accept her quest <i>then</i> and <i>there</i>—there is no "maybe" or "we'll get back to you on that"
                            with this woman. Also, you will not be able to accept the mistress's quest if your PC is a pureclassed Thief—she doesn't trust Thieves.
                            <li>Some quests should be postponed until at least Chapter 3, unless you know how to handle them. The next 6 quests can be very dangerous to attempt right off the bat, even for experienced players.
                            <li>In the Book of Kaza / Nether Scroll quests, you will be attacked right after crossing a party-required map transition. It's very likely that at least one of your party members <i>will</i> get Level Drained.
                            <li>It's advisable to hold off on the Umar Hills quest until all of your party members have +1 weapons, at the very least.
                            <li>The Unseeing Eye quest contains some extremely dangerous enemies: Do not venture into the "Lower Reaches" unless you're feeling very confident in your party's abilities. Also, the "Pit of the Faithless" area is
                            no-turning-back: You'll have to force your way forward to get out, but if you got through the Lower Reaches you should be fine. There is a "secret door" here that cannot be opened or lockpicked: The only way to open it is
                            to walk toward it from the North.
                            <li>The Planar Sphere contains many challenging enemies, and nearly the whole quest is no-turning-back: You cannot go home until you have beaten the entire thing. (You can leave, but you can't go home.) Do not enter unless
                            at least a couple of your Warriors have +3 weapons or better.
                            <li>Underneath the Five Flagons is a portal to an area that is very difficult for a young party: Full of quite difficult enemies, and you have to beat the whole quest before you can leave. Also, you have one and only one
                            shot at the quest: Bringing a specific item to the basement of the Five Flagons will result in the portal opening, and if you then leave the area and come back, the portal will have closed forever.
                            <li>Throughout the game are several doors and containers that are inaccessible through normal means; most of them are quest-related, meaning they can only be opened with a specific key (which may not be located anywhere
                            near the lock that it opens), or by starting a certain quest. Eventually, all areas and containers can be made available, except for the following: Many doors in Waukeen's Promenade lead to shops selling stuff that you, as
                            an adventurer, don't care about. The side door of the Delryn Estate can never be opened, and in fact leads nowhere. A couple of doors in the de'Arnisse Keep are similarly inoperative. In the Docks District is a door that
                            "is not a door, but rather a clever bit of moulding and painting on the wall." Don't worry yourself over these—trust me, you're not missing anything.

                            <li><font color=cc0000>Railroad plot:</font> Now that you have found an employer who will help you progress to Chapter 4, remember: If anybody directly affiliated with your employer turns Hostile to you, your entire party
                            will be killed.
                            <li>Before you embark onto Chapter 4, know that it's a very long journey, so be sure to pack wisely. Potions, ammo, spell scrolls, the works. Also, be warned that there are NO Temples at all in Chapter 5; pack accordingly.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Chapter 4:</b>
                            <li>You won't be able to leave Chapter 4 until you've completely beaten it—and once you <u>do</u> leave, you can never come back. Sound familiar?
                            <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
                            <li>The town of Brynnlaw has a small set of subquests. You don't have to do them, but if you leave town and then come back, the quests will be gone.
                            <li>Outside Brynnlaw, there's a box that's impossible to get to, even though it's a container. Don't worry about what's in it, it's just a small amount of random treasure: A few gold pieces, or maybe a Silver Necklace. 
                            Pretty exciting.
                            <li>There is a part in Chapter 4 that's a kind of dream sequence: You can control your PC normally, but your other party members are purple-circled and cannot do anything. I mention this because if you (for whatever
                            reason) boot anyone from your party at this point, you will be unable to talk to them to get them to rejoin.
                            <li>You see that hallway there, on the right? <b><u>DO NOT WALK HERE</u>.</b> Those two Traps that are shown in red are so large that your Thief has to <i>step</i> on them before he can get
                            close enough (to their centers) to Disarm them. Meaning, no matter what, you trigger the trap and your Thief is instantly crushed to death. How nice. So instead of walking here, just go around . . . and Save your game while
                            you're at it, because your last Auto-Save was quite a while back.
                            <li>There's a group of Hostile Kobolds here. Once they're dead, a second group appears, and you kill them too. Sometimes,
                            however, the 2nd group does not appear (perhaps because you killed the first group too quickly), which will cause you to be trapped, because they drop an item that you need to continue down

                            <li>You still can't go home yet. I <i>told</i> you it was a long journey, didn't I? You can't return to any areas you went through in Chapter 4, but once you're in Chapter 5, every place you go can be revisited, with two
                            exceptions: If you have a wardstone (It'll actually say "Wardstone" on it) to a place, the stone will only work once, and then disappear (It doesn't matter which doorway you use, they both go
                            to exactly the same place.) Also, the "Golden Rope" sidequest will take you to an area that can only be reached by following that quest. Both areas can be visited from Chapter 5 onward.
                            <li>The main map of Chapter 5 has markers denoting the "Eastern Tunnels" and the "Southern Tunnels." The "Western Tunnels" are also marked, but for whatever reason, the map marker is in a spot that's out of your line of
                            sight. This probably counts as a minor <font color=cc0000>bug</font>.
                            <li>Both the Southern and Eastern Tunnels are filled with extremely dangerous enemies, and you cannot leave the Eastern Tunnels until you've beaten the entire area. Also in the Eastern Tunnels are a pair of doors that say
                            "Only a powerful mind or godly strength can force this door open." Increasing your Strength to 25 (the maximum) will <u>not</u> work—BioWare wants you to be a little more creative than that.
                            <li>If you find an inscription that begins, "Place an animal sacrifice . . ." know that the word "place" is misleading: Items will not work.
                            <li>If you're in an area marked on your map as a "Bazaar," talk to people—3 of them are merchants. Annoyingly, they're not labeled "Merchant," so I missed them on my first game. Haven't they ever heard of advertising?
                            <li>You may encounter a woman who gives you a quest, saying (in part), "The guards will try to stop you in the treasury, if they see you. Kill them only if you must." This is not <i>strictly</i> accurate, so you may want to
                            make a backup-Save here.
                            <li>If you meet someone who tells you to go see someone named Elhan, you are almost at at the very end of Chapter 5. Continuing onward means your very next area transition will bring you to fresh air and (probably) sunlight,
                            and it will also start Chapter 6.

                            <li>You can <i>finally</i> go back to the areas (and quests) from Chapters 1, 2, and 3. But first you have to have a long talk with a guy named Elhan. He'll ask you a bunch of questions, and won't tell you why. He won't give
                            you any answers, and won't tell you why. He'll order you to go on a quest for him, and won't tell you why. It's too bad you can't kill him, because <font color=cc0000>Railroad Plot:</font> If Elhan or any of his followers
                            turn Hostile to you, they ALL turn hostile, and they'll keep respawning infinitely. Congratulations, you've screwed up the Main Plot.
                            <li>After talking with Elhan, 3 new areas will be added to your map. I don't know why they were restricted earlier in the game; they certainly don't give away any of the Main Plot or harm any of the game's other quests. One
                            of the new map areas, the Forest of Tethir, is a genuine pain to walk around in: Sometimes the fallen trees block your path, sometimes the fallen trees ARE the path. Keep that mouse pointer moving.
                            <li>The Railroad Plot warning for Chapter 2, the one that warned you not to anger any Shadow Thieves, is no longer in effect. (If it is, you've got a <font color=cc0000>bug</font>.)
                            <li>Following up on Elhan's quest may lead you to find that one of your party members didn't survive the encounter, and even though their body is intact, you will be unable to Raise or Resurrect them. Don't lose hope—the
                            effect <u>is</u> reversible. I suggest you hearken back to your days among the tomes in Candlekeep, and seek your answers through study. This problem takes precedence over Elhan's quest, by the way.<br>

                            <li>You can rush there as early as the very beginning of Chapter 2 of SoA, or you can postpone it until right before the final battle of ToB . . . or you could skip it entirely, I suppose (but why?), as well as leave & come
                            back as many times as you want. Anyway, go ahead and visit it early on for the very best rooftop shopping in the whole game, but I advise against actually <i>entering</i> the Keep too soon: If you enter the first level when
                            your average party level is less than 14, or you have fewer than 5 party members, the game will compensate and make the level less difficult for you, by removing some of the enemies. But one of those enemies has one of the
                            very best weapons of the whole saga, so entering the Keep too early means screwing yourself out of an excellent weapon.
                            <li>You'll never be trapped in Watcher's Keep. You can't progress to the next level down until you've beaten your current level, and there are some near-impossible fights in there, but at the very beginning of each level is
                            a gateway to the outside.
                            <li>The Portal Maze level is a lot more frustrating than it sounds. Make a map. I mean it, you'll find the level much easier to understand.
                            <li>The level after the Portal Maze does something rarely done in RPGs: It presents you with a puzzle but does NOT provide the solution, it only gives hints. Try to be open-minded and you should figure it out.
                            <li>If you do any part of Watcher's Keep while you're still in SoA, remember this: All weapons found in Watcher's Keep are potentially <i>extremely</i> valuable, even if you'll never use them. The same is true for bizarre,
                            random items that don't seem to have any purpose. Don't sell them, and don't leave them in some SoA area that you won't be able to get back to once you enter ToB. Either carry them on your person, or stash them in Watcher's
                            Keep itself.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>ToB (Main Plot):</b>
                            <li>There are two ways to take a character from the end of SoA to the beginning of ToB: You can either Import your character directly from the Final-Save of SoA, or beat the final battle of SoA and progress smoothly into ToB.
                            If you Import from your Final-Save, the Tears will <u>not</u> affect you (because the Final-Save predates their use).
                            <li>The party members who were with you in your Final-Save or when you beat SoA are still in your party, and soon you'll gain the ability to summon and recruit any of the <i>other</i> NPCs, too, even if you left them in some
                            SoA area. You can only do this with NPCs who were <u>still alive</u> when you left them, though.
                            <li>There is an all-new NPC available to you very soon after the beginning of ToB—right after the first fight, in fact.
                            <li>Your party members will no longer leave the party through conflicts with other members, or over Reputation issues, no matter what their Alignment is. You can still piss them off with what you <i>personally</i> say and do,
                            however.
                            <li>The city of Saradush has a very hostile atmosphere, and moving your party through the streets can be a real chore a times. It is possible to leave Saradush and come back, but only for a while: Once you go a bit further
                            in the plot, Saradush will be barred to you again, permanently.
                            <li>As you go further and further down the Main Plot, you may get the feeling that the enemies are getting cheesier and cheesier. I doubt anyone will think any less of you for replying in kind.
                            <li>Once you enter the Abyssal Fortress, <i>a.k.a.</i> the Throne of Bhaal, you will never again be able to Rest, no matter how much you want to.<br><br></list>

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is, in a sense, a continuum of gameplay attitudes, and all RPG players fall somewhere along its line.<br>

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At one end of the spectrum is the hardcore roleplayer, who immerses himself totally within the game, making all decisions with respect to how his <i>character</i> would feel about it, if his character has the Intelligence and Wisdom
                                    to make the right choice, even refusing very rewarding quests simply because his character is Chaotic, and doesn't like the idea of working for the woman offering that particular quest. The hardcore roleplayer denies himself all forms of outside help: No hints, no
                                    tips, no tricks—he might not even read much of the game's manual, for fear it might give something away. No out-of-game knowledge is allowed: If his <u>character</u> doesn't know it, <u>he</u> doesn't know it. The hardcore roleplayer does NOT Reload the game, ever
                                    (with the possible exception of encountering a bug), will not allocate any proficiency points to a weapon that he has not yet used in combat, and recruits new party members only when he happens to blunder into them, and their personalities seem to mesh with the

                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the other extreme, we find the hardcore powergamer, whose one drive is to beat the game, and beat the game HARD. He demands the utmost in everything: The most advantageous race/class/kit, the best party members using the deadliest
                                    weapons, and the optimum order in which to do quests, all in relentless pursuit of collecting ever more EXP. He reads full-disclosure walkthroughs, cheat codes, and uses every single opportunity available to pwn that n00b game as hard as it can possibly be pwned: If
                                    the game allows it, it's legal, and <i>should</i> be exploited for all it's worth—there is no such thing as "abuse." He's not happy unless he's winning winning winning; being anything less than the <b>very</b> best, most awe-inspiring character <u>ever</u> is
                                    simply a waste of his time.</table><br>
                                    
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All players are going to find themselves somewhere between these two endpoints, in terms of how much they care about storytelling and believable gameplay, vs. how much they care about steamrolling through the game. (It's possible
                                    to care quite a lot about both, but in most cases players find themselves favoring one side over the other.) Roleplayers deride powergamers for being "munchkin" and/or "cheesy," while powergamers mock roleplayers for being "stupid." Some examples of
                                    roleplaying "stupidity" include the "Snow White" party, in which the main character was a Female Bard who was not allowed to perform any action except sing her Bard Song and carry stuff—the real work was done by the other 5 party members, all of whom were
                                    Dwarves, Gnomes, or Halflings. There is also the tale of "The Reluctant Protagonist," in which the main character was a total coward: The player set his AI script to flee in terror whenever he saw an enemy. Most "stupid" of all, at least from a powergamer's
                                    point of view, the roleplayers who run these games frequently write up in-character reports of how their game is progressing, and post the installments on their favorite forum(s).<br>
                                    
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As for being "munchkin" and "cheesy," first I must define those terms. <b>Munchkin</b> is being visibly fixated on power and personal gain; this manifests most often in rolling one's stats (particularly when you "min-max" them,
                                    selecting one stat that you won't need and dropping it down to the absolute minimum, thus freeing up those points to drive those stats that you <u>do</u> want to their absolute effective maxima) and in use of metagaming knowledge; <i>e.g.</i>, taking the party
                                    on a long
                                    <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>journey to an obscure location that your character has no reason to go to yet, simply because you know there's an enemy there who drops this great Shield. <b>Cheese</b>, on the other hand, is not (necessarily) about power, but rather about your
                                    knowledge of the fact that you're playing a computer game: When you are aware of some possible flaw or unrealistic detail in the way that the game is implemented, and you choose to take advantage of it, that is cheese. The most infamous example of cheese is 
                                    the Fake-Talk "strategy:" Stand far away from some neutral creature, and click on them to talk to them. They will turn toward you, and wait for you to walk right up to them so the conversation can take place. Before you reach them,
                                    <td width=10><td><img src=images/backstab.jpg alt="Screenshot by Dundee Slaytern"></table>however, you cancel the action to speak to them, and instead
                                    direct your entire party to Attack them. Now, it is hardcoded that creatures prompted to talk will wait for nearly a full round for that conversation to begin, and during that round they will not attack, cast spells, or 
                                    even turn Hostile, so as long as you have 1 party member initiating (and breaking) conversation every round, you can effortlessly slaughter the mightiest creatures in the game without them lifting so much as a finger in their own defense.<br>
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Two terms closely related to "munchkin" are <b>overpowered</b> and <b>über</b>, which are synonymous and mostly used in the discussion of mods, to describe items, spells, or creatures that are noticably more powerful than
                                    comparable items, spells, and creatures from the default game. But some aspects of vanilla BG, especially BG2, are commonly judged to be overpowered as well, because at certain points of the game, your success or failure can depend not on your party's levels
                                    or preparedness, your own skill, or even the roll of the dice, but rather on whether or not you're using that particular item/spell/creature. The terms overpowered and über can be applied to all aspects of the game (frequently, the only safe way to defeat
                                    overpowered enemies is by using overpowered items, starting an "arms race" that quickly leaves most of the vanilla game in the dust), while munchkin is usually used to describe only the PC and his party.<br><br><hr><br>

                                    game will and <i>won't</i> let you do, especially if that might seem unrealistic. The goal is to present you with a range of options, to help you choose for yourself what your own personal playing style will be. I will at times state my own opinions
                                    on certain matters, but remember that that's <u>all</u> they are; <i>opinions</i>.<br><br>
                                    
                                    <b>Character Creation: Choosing your Class/Kit.</b><br>
                                    <u>Hardcore Powergaming Method</u>: Plan ahead and juggle your possible options for party members, choosing the most skilled and useful NPCs available, and build your main character in any of the stronger
                                    classes/kits that will best augment the strengths, and cover any possible weaknesses, of the party, so that all bases are covered as thoroughly as possible. If you are Dual-classing, work out precisely <i>when</i> you will Dual before you even begin the game,
                                    in order to get the maximum benefit from the Dual, and so that you can prepare ahead of time to have backup party members cover for you while your first class's skills are unavailable to you.<br>
                                    <u>Hardcore Roleplaying Method</u>: Choose whatever class, kit, or class combination whose ethos sounds like a fun character to play, even if it's a kit as badly implemented as the Beast Master, and just roll with it, recruiting party members as you bump into
                                    them. If you are Dual-Classing, perform the Dual at some crisis point in your character's emotional outlook: <i>e.g.</i>, if you encounter a quest in the game where a high-ranking Priest of the same god that your PC worships is revealed to be a false
                                    Cleric (in actuality offering secret prayers to an entirely different deity), that might be a good roleplaying moment for your PC Cleric to suddenly lose faith and Dual-class, regardless of what EXP level he might be at the time.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: Unless you're running a Solo game, putting together a well-balanced party is often critically important, so recruiting your desired NPCs quickly, and Dual-Classing at an appropriate level, both fall under the heading of simple
                                    "good tactics." But for roleplaying considerations, you might try to avoid visiting areas, even areas where your desired party members can be found, until your party has a valid in-game reason (with a relatively high priority) to go there. Also, consider
                                    rushing/delaying important plot events that might influence your Dual-Classing, so that they occur when your character is at a good level to start the Dual anyway.<br><br>
                                    
                                    <b>Character Creation: Rolling Your Stats.</b><br><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic41.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>
                                    <u>Hardcore Powergaming Method</u>: Keep hitting Reroll and examining the numbers, frequently adding them up and Saving the result when you get a stat total that exceeds the previous "high score." Once
                                    you have a total that is very high (usually above 90), pour those points into the stats that matter the most to how you intend to use the character, raising each stat all the way up to its effective maximum. The stats that you don't intend to use much (your
                                    "dump stats") can share however many stat points happen to be left over.<br>
                                    <u>Hardcore Roleplaying Method</u>: Whatever numbers come up the <i>very first time</i>, those are your stats. No Rerolls or moving points from one stat into another, at all.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: There are dozens, if not hundreds, of variations on this. You could limit the number of times you allow yourself to Reroll, and then min-max the best set of numbers you get from that, or you could Reroll as much as you want, but penalize
                                    yourself for min-maxing: For every point you add to a stat that's already 15 or higher, you have to subtract <i>two</i> points from somewhere else. Etc. My own method is to allow</table>myself as many Rerolls as I want, but I'm not allowed to move <b>any</b>
                                    stat points at all. This allows the potential for good stats but makes for less obvious min-maxing, and makes those good stats tedious to get but also rewards the patience required to Reroll so many times.<br><br>
                                    
                                    <b>Gameplay Situation: Party members are almost the only characters who can open & close doors.</b><br>
                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: In most situations, this is a non-issue. But if you find yourself losing a fight, it is often possible to run into another room and shut the door behind you. Even if the bad guy was right on your heels and you slammed the
                                    door right in his face, he will have no idea what just happened and will just stand at the door like an idiot, while you are free to heal yourself, re-evaluate your tactics, wait for his buffing spells to run out, and even Rest, because he can't figure out
                                    what a doorknob is.<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: Knowing the limitations of the game's AI, a roleplayer might decide to never close a door on an enemy, unless that enemy is known to be extremely stupid (<i>e.g.</i>, Golems), or they leave a bladed weapon near the door,
                                    under the roleplay that they wedged the door shut (applicable only on doors that swing open <i>toward</i> the party member).<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: Holding a door shut makes sense as long as you <i>remain</i> directly in front of the door, keeping it shut by force, and not using it to stop enemies whose Strength score is much higher than your own (or high enough to be able to simply
                                    break the door down).<br><br>

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Take advantage of it! If you're fighting a spellcaster, allow him to begin casting his spell, and then leave the area before he can complete it, thus wasting his spell(s). If you're being chased by Warriors, simply step out
                                    the door and most of them will fail to follow, so you can divide their forces and destroy them piece by piece. (In BG1, they can't follow you between areas at all.)<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: Give the game's AI the benefit of the doubt, and stand & fight until the battle is won (or lost), always keeping at least 1 party member in the area with the enemy.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: Do whatever you want, as long as you refrain from repeatedly ducking in & out of the enemy Mage's sight, thus forcing him to waste all of his high-level spellslots for no reason.<br><br>
                                    
                                    <b>Gameplay Situation: For speed & efficiency reasons, the BG2 engine tends to run the AI scripts of ONLY those creatures that are within the sight</b><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><b>range of at least one party member.</b><br>
                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Repeatedly use Area-of-Effect spells to harm, or even kill, powerful enemies that are just out of sight. Who cares if Dragons and Illithids would be smart enough to realize they're being attacked, and to either step out of
                                    the Cloudkill or simply retaliate?<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: Realize that if a non-party NPC needs to walk from Point A to Point B, it's best to walk beside him, chatting about the weather.

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Milk it whenever you want: By placing an allowed potion in your Backpack, saying "Drink Potion," and then removing the potion and quickly placing the outlawed potion or scroll in that exact same Inventory slot, you can fool
                                    the engine into granting you the effects of the item that's flagged as Unusable by you. Your Abjurer is barred from casting <font color=007700>Stoneskin</font>? Hell no he ain't.<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: Respect the rules—if your character is restricted from using a certain item, that restriction must have been put there for a reason.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: Use the Potion Swap cheese to circumvent only those restrictions that don't make sense. For instance, only Warriors can drink Potions of Hill Giant Strength . . . is there some secret Warrior "training" that teaches them the mysteries of
                                    how to uncork a bottle, tip the contents down your throat, and swallow?

                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: If the PC's Charisma score is sufficiently high, convince Xzar and Montaron that it really would be better for everyone if Monty went adventuring with the party while Xzar stayed behind in a tavern, chatting up the serving

                                    <i>can't</i> include Xzar is because of the arbitrary and unrealistic rule that that you can't have more than 6 party members, there's nothing wrong in using cheese to circumvent a hardcoded limitation.</table><br>

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Since both BG1 and BG2 occasionally have "caches," containers that contain valuable items but are hidden due to their very small size, the Tab key is a great way to avoid spending time and effort to find these little

                                    possible to use it only to make sure you've checked all the bodies, rather than as X-Ray machine that finds secret compartments for you.<br><br>

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Pause right before fulfilling the conditions that will cause the enemy to appear, and cast some buffing spells appropriate to the type of enemy that you know it's going to be. Possibly, call forth some good Summons, and buff
                                    them too. Then trigger the enemy's appearance, and clean up.<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: Everything depends on how much knowledge that the <i>party</i> has about what to expect—hardcore roleplayers shun the use of metagaming knowledge. Unless the party has some fore-warning (or the main character has a Wisdom

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Same as before: Buff the hell out of the party, but with the exception of Summoned creatures (because Summons cannot cross area transitions), then proceed to kick as much ass as possible.<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: It seems pretty clear that BioWare meant your encounter with this group of enemies to be a sudden surprise attack; a hardcore roleplayer might choose to knowingly have his party blunder right into the fight, without any
                                    preparation at all.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: Ordinarily, you would be scouting ahead with your Thief. But since the new map area is party-required ("You must gather your party before venturing forth"), you can have no warning of the impending battle before you're already in it. But
                                    since the "party-required" bit is an unrealistic restriction imposed on you by the game engine, it seems perfectly kosher to <i>pretend</i> that your Thief fully scoped out the enemy, and cast your prebuffs anyway. Of course, this only works in "mundane" map
                                    transitions, where your Thief would simply sneak through a door, check out what's on the other side, and then report back. In more exotic area transitions, <i>e.g.</i>, you step through a magic portal that closes behind you, this would not be a plausible
                                    tactic.<br><br>

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Use Traps with the specific intention of not giving the bad guys a chance. If the powergamer knows that an enemy will appear at a certain spot, he will Trap that spawn point. What's more, if multiple enemies come within range
                                    of a Trap at the exact same instant, the Trap will go off and hit them <i>all</i>. Pretty much the only protection from Traps is to be immune to Missile damage, which is provided by <font color=007700>Stoneskin</font>—but there's a brief second between
                                    Dimension Dooring into the area and one's automatic buffs taking effect—and in that second, the Traps will hit the target and likely kill them. Moreover, if you lay all your Traps on the exact same spot, stacked on top of each other (try doing that in real
                                    life), any enemy that comes in range of <i>one</i> them will be within range of all the others as well—meaning they will unavoidably get hit with 7 Traps simultaneously, which can kill pretty much anything. What's more, while regular Snares are always set at
                                    the Thief's feet, Bounty Hunters' Set Special Snare ability has a range of 30, meaning they can effectively "throw" their Snares into the middle of an ongoing fight (which is clearly ridiculous), possibly even hitting multiple opponents each time. Possibly the
                                    cheesiest exploit of all, however, is</table>setting Traps near a creature that is not Hostile to you, but (possibly through metagaming knowledge) you know soon will be.<br>

                                    They will always shun actually abusing Traps by placing them close together, having a Bounty Hunter "throw" his Special Snares, or laying them where an (unexpected) enemy will appear. They <i>might</i> set Traps near a not-yet-Hostile creature <b>if</b> the
                                    Thief is Stealthed or Invisible while doing so.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: I'm not sure there is one, really—either you cheese the use of Traps, or you don't.<br><br>

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Go nuts with your best Pickpocket! This works because whenever the game wants "Billy Bob" to be present, it creates a "Billy Bob," <i>complete</i> with all his gear. If any of that gear can be Pickpocketed from him, it can be
                                    nicked from him each time, enabling you to gain multiple copies—sometimes, even unique and very powerful items can be duplicated in this fashion. If you were to <i>kill</i> Billy Bob at your first meeting, however, you would only get
                                    the one copy, because the game knows not to create him again if he's already dead.<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer would do</u>: Needless to say, any self-respecting roleplayer wouldn't touch this exploit with a stick.<br>
                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: To acquire duplicates of supposedly unique items and use them in combat would clearly be extremely cheesy . . . but you might be okay with <i>selling</i> them instead of actually using them. You could also rationalize getting (and keeping)
                                    multiples of more mundane items, depending on the NPC's personal circumstances and the amount of time between appearances: If he's a poor commoner and all he did was step outside into the street, he obviously hasn't been able to obtain another Emerald. But if
                                    he's rich and you haven't seen him for days, he's had ample opportunity to refill his pockets.<br>

                                    <u>What a Powergamer might do</u>: Milk it. If you're a Mage fighting a bunch of enemies with high Magic Resistance, no big deal—just cast Protection from Fire, and then walk among them, Fireballing yourself, and giggle as you watch them burn.<br>
                                    <u>What a Roleplayer might do</u>: Recognize that the reason for this mechanic is to prevent self-targeted things like Healing spells and drinking Antidotes from failing simply because you're resistant to harmful spells—it was never intended to be used to

                                    <u>Middle Ground</u>: In BG2, only offensive spells can be blocked by Magic Resistance, but in BG1, MR can block <i>all</i> spells. It makes little sense that a person would <b>want</b> protection from beneficial spells, so when casting party buffs like Chant
                                    and Haste, it's hardly an abuse of the system to have each caster target the spells on themselves when there's a magic-resistant party member.<td width=10><td><img src=images/pic46.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"></table><br>

                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just about every kind of video game has cheats built into it, and Baldur's Gate is no exception用articularly since it's been out for more than 10 years, so it's
                                        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>only natural that its workings would have been thoroughly figured out by now. There are a few basic reasons to cheat:<br>
                                        1) <b>Cheating to correct bugs in the game.</b> Even in a game that is properly patched & Fixpacked, <font color=cc0000>bugs</font> can unfortunately still occur. Usually, the only fair way to remedy the
                                        situation is to operate from outside of the game for a bit. One known <font color=cc0000>bug</font> that is both irritatingly intermittent and (apparently) unfixable is that sometimes, Thieves who Dual to
                                        another class and get their Thief half back in ToB may discover that, upon reactivation of their Thief class, the game has <i>forgotten</i> about all the points that they had allocated into their Thieving
                                        skills. If this should happen to you, the only way to correct the problem is to hack your Thieving skills back to where they're supposed to be.
                                        <td width=10><td><a href=images/helmclones.jpg><img src=images/thelmclones.jpg alt="Happily, the 'Respawning NPC' bug is now fixed, in all versions of the game."></a></table>
                                        2) <b>Cheating for testing purposes.</b> Usually done only by modders or people foolish enough to be writing an encyclopedic website about the game, this is purely exploratory in nature耀eeing how well
                                        something works, or if it even works at all.<br>
                                        3) <b>Cheating for stylistic/roleplay reasons.</b> Multi-classed and Dual-classed characters use the avatar and paperdoll of whichever of their classes has the larger Hit Dice: If you're a Fighter/Thief, you
                                        look like a Fighter. If you're a Cleric->Mage, you look like a Cleric, even while your Cleric half is buried in the Dual. You might very well decide, "Heck no, I'm wearing Mage Robes now, damn right I wanna
                                        see what they look like," and so you hack your avatar to Male (or Female) Human Mage. This has absolutely no effect on gameplay, its only function is cosmetic, so there's clearly nothing unfair about it. You
                                        can even change your avatar into an Ogre or Ettercap or <font color=007700>Beholder</font> if you really want to. But note that the avatars not legally available to party characters do not have paperdolls, and
                                        many of them have side affects: Some creature avatars are too big to fit through most doorways, some have faster or slower Movement Rates, and some have no spellcasting animations: If you try to cast a spell
                                        while using one of these avatars, the game will crash.<br>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some cheating done for roleplay purposes <i>does</i> have actual impact on the game, however: According to the rules, Elves cannot have less than 8 Charisma, but suppose you 
                                        wanted to roleplay a really repugnant Elf, with involuntary projectile vomiting and a penchant for making improper suggestions to attractive females. So just hack your Charisma down to an illegal (for Elves,
                                        anyway) value, and there you go. Or suppose you wanted to play an illegal race/class combination, like a Gnomish Ranger or a Half-Orc Bard. Or you might want to make some cheating changes based on some legal
                                        changes: For example, if your Strength score should happen to go from 18 up to 19, your Weight Allowance would suddenly jump from 200 pounds all the way up to 500預nd you might decide that that kind of
                                        muscle growth fully justifies hacking on some extra Charisma, as well.<br>
                                        4) <b>Cheating to correct your own mistakes.</b> Suppose you need a certain item (such as a key) to do something, and you KNOW you had it, you just can't remember where you left it. Some people (usually of a
                                        roleplaying bent) will scour the game for where they might have left it, and if they <i>still</i> can't find it, give up
                                        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><img src=images/pic24.jpg alt="Art by Mike Sass"><td width=10><td>that quest as a lost cause. Others (usually powergamers) will simply hack the key back into their
                                        Inventory (or adjust the game variable, or whatever) immediately, without even spending 5 minutes to backtrack & discover where they might have dropped it.<br>
                                        5) <b>Cheating solely to make your character/party more powerful.</b> Many players do this, for a variety of reasons. There are a few who give themselves all the best items in the game right from Day 1, or
                                        drop their THAC0 to -12 or whatever, simply because that's what makes the game more fun for them. Others will mitigate that somewhat, using various roleplaying-ish justifications for doing so; like starting a
                                        new character in BG2, and hacking his EXP from 89,000 all the way up to 161,000葉he same EXP he would have earned if he'd been started in BG1 and taken through a full game of BG1+TotSC, without the time and
                                        bother of taking him through a full game of BG1+TotSC. While you are of course free to play the game in whatever manner you please, be aware that as a general rule, cheating to make things easier for yourself
                                        isn't going to impress people a whole lot when you talk about your character on the forums.</table><br><hr><br>
                                        
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That was the <i>why</i>, now it's time for the <i>what</i>. Back in Chapters 6 & 7, I said that the various items & spells in the game do one heck of a lot of different things;
                                        cheating, however, opens those doors of possibility even wider, because there are some <b>opcodes</b> that the vanilla game does not use. Sure, you can do basic stuff like creating & removing items and
                                        creatures in the middle of your game, or messing with your hitpoints or Resistances or changing game variables, that's easy. But if you're interested in cheating more creatively and constructively, you can do
                                        things like make an Amulet that takes Alteration spells cast directly at the wearer, and bounces them right back at the person who cast them. Or if you think Enemy X is too easy a kill for where he appears
                                        in-game, you can tweak his stats to be a more respectable opponent. You can alter the game's DIALOG.TLK file and correct the <font color=cc0000>bug</font> in Degrodel's line where he says 'Ragefast' instead
                                        of 'Ramazith.' You can create all-new spells for your party to learn and cast, and edit the AI of various enemies in the game to give <b>them</b> the ability to cast those spells too. You can edit the game's
                                        data files and straighten out the Druid's funky EXP progression, or make Mages get 5 Lore per level instead of 3. Of course, changes at these levels sort of stop being <i>cheats</i> and start becoming more
                                        like <i>mods</i>, which is more appropriate for the next chapter, so let's ramp it back down to cheating.<br><br>
                                        
                                        <b>Q: "What can I change about my character?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: Pretty much anything you see in the Records screen.</b> Your Race, Class, Kit, Gender, hitpoints, proficiency points, etc.
                                        There are some limits, determined by the hardcoded settings of the game, but those are few. If you don't like being an Illusionist and would rather be an Enchanter instead, you can do that (and yes, the
                                        Evocation spells you learned while an Illusionist will remain in your spellbook, but if you want to be fair you can delete them). If you disagree with the Dual-Classing rule that lets you choose a kit for
                                        your <i>first</i> class but not your <i>second</i>, you can remedy that. You can even give your character a kit of a completely different class様ike putting the Berserker kit on a Bard. You can never have
                                        <i>more</i> than one kit on any one character, though. Also, you can hack illegal equipment onto your characters (like making a Wizard Slayer wear magical rings & the like), but these illegal items will
                                        automatically be kicked down into the character's Backpack the next time he Levels Up.<br><br>
                                        
                                        <table cellpadding=cellspacing=0><tr><td>
                                        <b>Q: "What can I change about the game I'm currently playing?"<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: Again, pretty much anything.</b> Rather than repeat myself, I'll just direct you to the next section down 
                                        this page (the <i>how</i> of cheating) for a list of <b>some</b> of the things that can be done. As far as major things that you <u>can't</u> do, the only one that comes to mind is hacking in the recruitable
                                        NPCs to join your party: You can enter the code that creates the creature, and you can talk to them, and they will join you just like they normally would, but as soon as you try to Save the game or move from
                                        one major map area to another, the game immediately crashes. (That's what happens in BG1, at least.) The only safe way to cheat in party members is to teleport yourself to their
                                        location, recruit the <u>real</u> one, and then teleport back. Hacking in barnyard animals to get revenge on snotty Nobles, however, works just fine.<td width=10><td><a href=images/barnyard.jpg>

                                        spells into your game will only affect <i>that one game</i>, but if you start messing with actual files you could potentially screw up <i>every</i> game of BG you play from then on. Happily, the editing
                                        programs used to alter *.CRE, *.ITM, and *.SPL files are less user-friendly than the ones used for editing your Savegames, so that in itself tends to ward off players who don't (yet) know what they're doing.
                                        One thing to watch out for is asking the game to use animations that don't exist: If you try to make a Crossbow that's held in only 1 hand, or a Wolf that can cast spells, or a Staff that <font color=007700>
                                        Monks</font> can use, the computer will look for the *.BAM files that show a 1-handed Crossbow, or a Wolf casting a spell, or a Monk holding a 2-handed weapon . . . and when it fails to find them, the game
                                        will crash.<br><br>

                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And now, the juicy bit: <i>How</i> to cheat.<br><br>
                                        
                                        The first type of cheating isn't cheating at all, but rather simple (and mostly cosmetic) file manipulation謡hich is actually <i>reqired</i> to move your character from BG1 into BG2, a practice that BioWare
                                        encourages. When you beat BG1, the game automatically exports your character's *.CHR file to the Characters folder (a subdirectory of the main BG1 folder). Simply take that file (usually named CHAR1.CHR) and
                                        drop it into the Characters folder of your BG2 directory. Then start a new game of BG2, and instead of rolling a character from scratch, press the "Import" button and select CHAR1. You'll have to reassign
                                        your weapon proficiencies & Thieving skills (to be completely different from how you had them in BG1, if you want), and you'll also have the opportunity to change your name, in case you
                                        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>decided that playing as a character named "Hemorrhoids" wasn't<td width=20><td><img src=images/hemo04.jpg></table>
                                        really such a great idea after all. Exporting a player-made character isn't limited to the end of BG1; you can do it at any point of either game.<br>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Perhaps the most common type of manipulation is using custom portraits. If you are dissatisfied with the portraits that come with the game, you can add more: There are multiple
                                        websites from which you can download new pictures, or you can even make your own: Take any image and make two copies of it, one 110x170 pixels and the other 38x60 pixels. Both images must be bitmaps with
                                        24-bit depth (saving the pictures in Microsoft Paintbrush works for this). If you wish, you can also make a third image, 210x330 pixels, but this is highly optional as it's only used once, at the very end of
                                        ToB葉here's an Epilogue after you beat the game. Downloadable portrait sets contain only the small and medium pictures, not the large. Once you have the finished bitmap images, simply put them into the
                                        Portraits

                                        longbows, and a well-deserved reputation as a ladies' man. He's a freelance Thief, unaffiliated with any guild or other larcenous organization. For whatever reason, BioWare saw fit to give him the picture on
                                        the left: A Human with no chin and a dumbass haircut, who dual-wields daggers and wears the mark of the Shadow Thieves of Amn. If you should happen to find a picture that you think looks more like Coran (with
                                        the picture on the right being one example), you can have Coran use that picture by making the 2 bitmap files described above, giving them the same names as the images that Coran normally uses (CORANL.BMP and
                                        CORANS.BMP), and putting those files into your game's Override directory. If you want to go back to the original, just move or delete those 2 files.<td width=10><td><img src=images/coran.jpg></table>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Similar to custom portraits are custom soundsets. These exist in *.WAV format and are saved to the Sounds folder: Each complete soundset consists of dozens of individual files,
                                        which must all be correctly named, but I'll assume that whatever site you're downloading these from has already done that job for you. As

                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last main type of file manipulation is alternating between Multiplayer & Single Player: If you're not content with the variety of recruitable NPCs in the game, you can roll
                                        your own by starting a Multiplayer game, and making as many characters as you want. Then start the game, Save, and quit. Move the Saved-game folder you just made from the "mpsave" to the "save" directory,
                                        and start BG again: You are now playing a regular, Single-Player game of BG, but with 1 or more extra party members that you rolled yourself.

                                        Now we move on to <b>real</b> cheating. The first two methods were built-in by BioWare, largely so they could fix bugs in the game while they were playtesting it. The game engines of BG1 and BG2 are based on
                                        something called a LUA platform, which may be issued commands in the middle of a game by using the CLUA Console. To access this console, you'll need to quit the game, open up the directory that contains the
                                        game (the default installation paths are <b>C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Baldur's Gate</b> and <b>C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA</b> for BG1 and BG2, respectively), and find the file BALDUR.INI. Open
                                        it up, and add a couple of lines: Find the line that says [Program Options], and directly underneath it, add the lines<blockquote>
                                        Debug Mode=1<br>Cheats=1<br>CheatKeys=1<br></blockquote>
                                        exactly as you see them written here. Then add those 3 lines again, underneath the line that says [Game Options]. The "Cheats" and "Debug Mode" commands allow access to the CLUA console, and the "CheatKeys"
                                        activates certain cheat commands for BG2. Both the Console and the CheatKeys were originally added for game-testing and bugfixing purposes. To show the Console, during a game of BG1 (while you're on the Main
                                        Game Screen) press CTRL-TAB to show or hide the Console. In BG2, the Console is brought up by pressing CTRL-SPACE. The Console itself is just a small window in which you can type text, which tells the game
                                        to do certain things:<blockquote>

                                        You can use different parameters in most of the CLUA commands: SetCurrentExp and AddGold will set Experience Points and increment the Party Gold in accordance with the integer you use in the command,
                                        although the game will still not allow a party member's EXP to exceed the EXP cap. The commands of CreateItem, CreateCreature, AddSpell, MoveToArea, and GetGlobal / SetGlobal will operate in reference to
                                        whatever item, creature, spell, map area, or variable (respectively) that you specify. In these latter commands, the parameters (the filename of the item, map area, etc.) of each command are not
                                        case-sensitive, but the rest of the command line (the "CLUAConsole:" bit and the actual command you want it to execute) must be typed <i>exactly</i> as you see it above.<br><br>
                                        
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The final type of cheating (that I'll discuss in this chapter, anyway) is the use of Savegame Editors. The first was <b>Gatekeeper</b>, named after Baldur's Gate,
                                        <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top>which
                                        evolved into <b>Shadowkeeper</b> after the release of Shadows of Amn. Shadowkeeper was then reverse-engineered into <b>Sword Coast Keeper</b>, apparently because the original Gatekeeper program was
                                        incompatible with some of the changes introduced in TotSC. These editors exist largely through the hard work and good graces of Aaron O'Neil, and can be used to make changes to the party members (stats,
                                        race, class, hitpoints, combat stats, equipment, spells, skills, colors, etc.) and the global variables that are part of any saved game. The original Gatekeeper also allowed you to change your party's
                                        location, giving you the option to choose from a large number (although not 100%) of the game's major map areas as the map where your party would appear once you loaded up that edited Savegame. The Keepers
                                        are the most powerful hacking tools described in this chapter; they can do most of what the CheatKeys do, and duplicate almost all of the CLUA commands, and there's tons of stuff that can only be done by
                                        editing Savegames耀uch as hacking your Thieving skills back up to where they were before you Dual-Classed. One important fact about the Keepers is that it's not a good idea to run them <i>and</i> the game
                                        itself at the same time. Sword Coast Keeper, for one, locks the game's DIALOG.TLK file so it can access it預nd while it's in use by SCK, BG1 cannot read from it, and therefore cannot boot up. The reverse is
                                        also true, in that SCK cannot load while BG1 is running. As a general rule, avoid leaving the game running while you're messing with any editor.<td width=10>

                                        scratched, for instance), you'll need to hunt down the <i>specific</i> file(s) in question: If the game always crashes upon casting a certain spell, or playing a certain movie, or entering a certain map
                                        area, there's your culprit. Your best bet is probably to go on the forums, and ask somebody to email a (zipped) copy of that file to you.<br>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The game can get stuck at certain points if you're Invisible: If somebody needs to deliver a plot-central bit of dialogue to you, but they can't speak to you because they can't
                                        see you, they (and the game) won't know what to do, and you could all be standing around for quite a long time. This may have been remedied in the Fixpack, giving those important NPCs the ability to see
                                        invisible creatures for those critical dialogues.<br>

                                        Now that you know why, when, and how to cheat, all you have to remember is one simple rule: <u>Do</u> <u>Not</u> <u>Cheat</u>. Remember what I said in Chapter 3, that your first game is your <i>ONE chance
                                        </i> to see the game as it was meant to be seen, and how <b>all</b> of your future games are going to be colored by your metagaming knowledge of your first trip? Yeah, sure, if you really WANT to spend
                                        your maiden voyage through BG as little more than a tagalong being dragged behind the Killsword as it carves through the game, you can do that . . . but if <i>that's</i> your idea of fun, why play the game
                                        at all? Why even read this website? Also, if you make edits before you're sure how things are supposed to turn out, you could do more harm than good, reaching the endpoints of certain quests and then going
                                        back to do the middle, and in general screwing everything up. No, as a newbie you have little choice but to assume that everything you encounter will be bug-free; if Reloading doesn't change anything, just
                                        accept it, or at most go to one of the Internet forums about the game and post your questions there. (To observe proper decorum, however, search their archives for related threads first.) Later on, after
                                        you've played through the game (or at least that section of it) a couple of times, you'll have learned what's correct and what's not. Remember, I list some "this container cannot be opened by any means"
                                        and "this door is barred from the other side" in my Walkthrough. You'd better check to make sure your "bug" isn't one of those.</table>

                                        through production much more hastily than BG1), but that's why the G3 Fixpack (and its predecessor, BaldurDash) is so thorough. <u>Most</u> bugs that <i>can</i> be fixed <i>have</i> been fixed. Still, you
                                        will occasionally<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign=top>
                                        run into something odd, or even something bad. But that doesn't mean it's a bug: It could be intended behavior, it could be that you actually didn't do something as correctly as you
                                        think you did, or it could simply be a freak accident. When you encounter a strangeness, your first reaction should <u>not</u> be to reach for the CLUAConsole or the CheatKeys, nor should it be to Save
                                        the game and call in the Keeper. When you hit what you think is a bug, your first reaction should be to <b>Reload and try it again.</b> 9 times out of 10, the situation will function normally. It's a
                                        "no-problem" problem, my very favorite kind.<td width=10><td><img src=images/rumar.gif></table><br>

                                        <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A: Use cheats to re-create the correct game behavior as closely as possible.</b> For example, suppose that there's a door you have to open, and in spite of your having
                                        done everything perfectly correctly, that door just <i>refuses</i> to open. If Reloading doesn't fix it, and the door is controlled by a variable, you should Save, and try using the appropriate Keeper to
                                        set the variable to (what you think is) the correct value. If that doesn't work, your best bet is to use CTRL-J and/or MoveToArea to teleport the party to the exact spot where they would be after stepping
                                        through the door.<br>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the event that you need to talk to somebody, and that person is (wrongly) Hostile to you, again, your best bet is to Reload. If they still want to kill you, try CTRL-Y on
                                        them (Note: Not even CTRL-Y works on everything, some creatures are wearing "MINHP1" items that prevent them from dying through hitpoint loss), and then use CreateCreature to spawn another copy
                                        of them擁f this version isn't mad at you, they should behave correctly. Beware, however: Many creatures have <i>several</i> versions of themselves, all with the same creature name ("Bob") but different
                                        filenames (BOB01, PPBOB, C6BOB, etc.), so you may need to make many attempts to CLUA in the correct預nd <i>only</i> the correct要ersion, otherwise you may compound the problem by using cheats to
                                        affect portions of the game that you shouldn't legally be even able to get to yet.</table><br>

                                        <b>Chapter 12: Mods & Modding</b><font size=3></center><br><br>
    
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "Mod" is short for "modification," and like more & more nouns these days, it is also a verb. To date, there are dozens of modders who have collectively produced hundreds of mods, a total which continues to rise.
                                            It is the aspect of modding that has preserved the games of Baldur's Gate so far beyond their expected shelf lives; no matter how old the game is, there is always another mod to try. Some mods are very small, something as simple as a single
                                            custom item that players can drop into their Override folder and hack into their game. Some mods are very large, comprising new items, new spells, new creatures, new quests, new recruitable NPCs, new music, and new map areas. The basic
                                            difference between cheating and modding is that mods are developed with the intent to be placed online, and then downloaded (for free) and used by a large number of other players.<br>
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some mods are WeiDU, and some are non-WeiDU. Non-WeiDU came first, and involves the basic practice of creating/editing files, and slapping them all into your Override folder. This works, but there are two big
                                            problems with it. <b>1)</b> You can't uninstall a non-WeiDU mod: To undo the changes made in installation, you have to delete the files from the Override folder, and if those files are required for the game to operate, you're not going to
                                            have much fun playing the game. Uninstalling a non-WeiDU mod means uninstalling the entire game and reinstalling from scratch. <b>2)</b> If any two non-WeiDU mods alter the same file, the last mod to be installed will overwrite the previous
                                            one; none of the previous mod's changes to that file will be retained. This can lead to lots of bugs when other parts of a partially-overwritten mod try to call on the overwritten file. For this reason, old guides to Baldur's Gate specify
                                            that you install a maximum of ONE non-WeiDU mod, because of this built-in incompatibility issue. Not me: I specify that you shouldn't install <u>ANY</u> non-WeiDU mods. For starters, good luck finding any: WeiDU's been out for years, and
                                            literally EVERY mod worth the download uses it. If you do manage to find a a non-WeiDU mod, that means three things: It's several years old and therefore a bit primitive, it's not supported anymore (if you find a bug, you won't be able to
                                            notify the maker of the mod, because he's probably disappeared), and the quality of the mod itself isn't likely to be that good—if it were, somebody would have bothered to convert it to WeiDU by now.<br>
                                            <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enter Westley Weimer and his <b>Wei</b>mer <b>D</b>ialog <b>U</b>tility. It was originally meant to change specific strings in the DIALOG.TLK file while maintaining the integrity of the file as a whole, but he
                                            quickly adapted it for other things as well, things like altering specific cells in a 2DA file without touching any of the other data, or inserting an entire new line or column at any point in the table. Now, using WeiDU, multiple mods can
                                            make changes to the same file, without touching changes made by other mods (unless both mods wanted to change the <i>exact same property</i> of the file, such as the number of proficiency points in Spear that a certain creature has). What's
                                            more, WeiDU mods use a built-in intelligent install: When an existing file is changed, a copy of the original file is saved to a Backup folder, of which each mod has one. When you want to uninstall the mod, the uninstaller automatically
                                            deletes the relevant<td width=10><td><img src=images/weidu.jpg alt="A WeiDU mod being installed. Most good mods have distinct components, which can be installed together or separately, allowing you to pick & choose what you want."></table>

                                            rid of mod B, WeiDU will automatically uninstall C, then uninstall B, and then <u>re</u>-install C. You can see why nobody makes non-WeiDU mods anymore.<br><br><hr><br>
                                            
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next up, a quick look at some important / popular mods. Note that this is only a <b>small</b> selection of the number of mods out there—as I said, there are hundreds. This cross-section gives a good sampling
                                            of what can be done, and also reflects the fact that most mods are written for BG2.<br><br>
                                            
                                            <b>BaldurDash</b>, <b>Dudleyfix</b>, and the <b>Gibberling Three Fixpacks</b><br>
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These are, essentially, mods that have the additional layer of respectability of being endorsed by some of the very BioWare employees who helped design/code the game itself. They fix bugs and other behavior
                                            confirmed to be unintended by the original developers, as well as a slew of other changes that are solidly in the realm of "corrections" rather than just "tweaks." BaldurDash was first, written by Kevin Dorner, but eventually he stopped
                                            supporting & updating it, so the metaphysical baton was taken up by other modders, who produced more modern, comprehensive versions: Dudleyfix is meant to be supplemental to the BaldurDash fixes for BG1, while the G3 Fixpack replaces
                                            BaldurDash entirely for BG2. Having BaldurDash / the G3 Fixpack is considered <i>essential</i> to a (mostly) bug-free game, at least in BG2.<br><br>

                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Makes most of the major fights in ToB (especially the final battle) more difficult, with more (and tougher) enemies and more fireworks. The last fight of Watcher's Keep is notable in that it is restored to
                                            its original specifications, before BioWare decided to ramp it down to make the game appealing to a wider cross section of players.<br><br>

                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not all of the ideas developed for the game made it into the final product: For various reasons (usually time constraints), some are only half-implemented, while other content
                                            exists only as program files that are never actually seen in the (vanilla) game. Unfinished Business goes after these loose ends, finding a place for forgotten items, creatures, and lines of dialogue. Not ALL dropped threads are
                                            restored, however; some plots are still rather tricky to piece together, and not <i>every</i> idea BioWare had was good, but on the whole, the UB mods (there's one for BG1 and another for BG2) bring the game a lot closer to what was

                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Virtue mod takes the concept of Reputation and turns it on its ear, by introducing Virtue as a sister variable, with a similar function but marked differences: Reputation now indicates only what the common
                                            folk think of you, while your Virtue reflects the "goodness" of your actions and how your party members feel about it. This system adds realism: In the default game, you could murder some innocent commoner out in the middle of nowhere, and
                                            even though there was absolutely nobody around to see it, your Reputation would go down. With Virtue, this action leaves your Reputation untarnished, it's your Virtue that takes the hit. All party members love having a high Reputation (and
                                            the NPC reactions & store discounts that it brings), while their opinion of how you've been running the party is now based solely on your Virtue.<br>

                                            classes & kits, and Weapon Styles. Requires a full installation of BG1 (or BG1 + TotSC), as well as having BG2 as well. You cannot quickly alternate between a Tutu game and a game
                                            of regular BG2: You must first re-run the conversion program and tell the BG2 engine to stop pulling BG1's files and go back to using the BG2 resources instead. This is the
                                            mod to which I was referring back on the homepage of this Guide, when I said that more & more games of BG1 are being played on the BG2 engine.<br><br>

                                            next to where you start the game—and if you ask him to, he'll teleport you to the exit, and give you all the items and EXP that you would have collected if you'd actually slogged through the opening all over again.<br><br>

                                            they have the potential to involve maybe a little innocent flirting, maybe a candlelight dinner, or maybe even . . . certain endeavors of a vaguely athletic nature.

                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In PnP, Priest spells have "Spheres" just like Wizard spells have Schools, and your access to particular Spheres is determined by which god(s) you worship. In BG2, however, all Clerics and all Druids have access
                                            to (almost) exactly the same spells as any other Cleric or Druid. Divine Remix takes the Spheres template and implements it for BG, giving all divine spellcasters (Clerics, Druids, Paladins, & Rangers) a reportoire that more accurately
                                            reflects the methods and portfolios of their respective deities—not to mention that it adds a number of new Cleric, Ranger, and Druid kits.<br><br>

                                            banters with other party members, and even a romantic dialogue path with the PC. Since its inception, Solaufein has paved the way for many other NPC mods, some of which even surpass the original.<td width=10><td width=10>

                                            them more responsive to the caster's level, enabling low-level spells to remain useful even late in the game.<br><br>

                                            mods are WeiDU or not, there's still a chance that they're going to step on each other, but you can reduce the odds of this happening by installing your mods (or the components thereof) in roughly the proper sequence. For the most part,
                                            this entails simply installing mods in the order that they were released/updated: More recently updated mods contain workarounds that help them avoid conflicting with older ones. Regardless of release date, however, some mods depend on or
                                            influence material changed by other mods, and therefore should be installed after those mods: This ordering should be documented in the READMEs of the specific mods. If you encounter a problem that you think is a <font color=cc0000>
                                            bug</font>, caused either by a single mod or a likely conflict between two different mods, the best place to ask for advice is on the forum of the mod(s) concerned. You'll be asked to post the contents of your WeiDU.LOG file, so people can

                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, you've decided to spend many hours of your free time learning how to spend <i>more</i> hours of your free time making modifications to an unpopular game that's over 10 years old. You will assuredly
                                            never see a penny from your labors, in fact the only reward you could possibly gain is the praise & kudos of we unfortunates who are now your peers. Congratulations, you're insane. How's it feel? But don't worry—at least you're in good
                                            company. Here's a step-by-step guide to the road down which madness lies:<br><br>
                                            1) Play the game several times.<br>
                                            2) Get an idea for a mod, something that you think will improve the game.<br>
                                            3) Accept the fact that in all probability, what you want to do (or at least portions of it) simply <u>cannot</u> be done. Really, just accept it. Don't keep banging your head
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp against hardcoded limitations, leave that to more experienced modders like Taimon, Avenger, and Ascension64, who can (sometimes) actually do something
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp about it. <i>Your</i> time would be better spent working <i>within</i> the rules, not trying to change them. (You can, however, work <u>around</u> some rules, perhaps in
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp interesting ways.)<br>
                                            4) Become a regular on at least one of the game's forums, absorbing the knowledge of those around you. Try to find a tutorial for the kind of mod that you want to
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp write. Failing that, find and download somebody else's mod that's similar to what you want to do—study the .TP2 and learn how the code is put together.
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The more thoroughly-commented the TP2 is, the more successful you're likely to be.) If you cannot find an existing mod that's related to your idea, <i>put your
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp idea on the back burner for now.</i> Instead, make a mod that's similar to something already out there. Once you've got your feet wet and are less likely to get
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp frustrated/discouraged, come back to your master plan.<br>
                                            5) If you don't have some way to send & recieve compressed files, like WinZip or WinRAR or something, get one.<br>
                                            6) Download <a href=http://www.weidu.org/main.html#weidu target="weidu">WeiDU</a>. The download contains both the WeiDU program itself and a website that lists all of WeiDU's functions and how to use them. Despite its
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp size, I found the website rather on the uninformative side; partly because the majority of it described things I didn't (yet) want to do, partly because I'd
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp already learned what I wanted from other sources, and partly because it was written <i>by</i> a Unix geek, <i>for</i> Unix geeks. But your mileage may vary.<br>
                                            7) Download (or just bookmark) <a href=http://iesdp.gibberlings3.net/ target="iesdp">IESDP</a>. This is a website that covers most of the basics of modding, enough to get you started doing whatever it was that you
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp wanted to do. There are a few errors in it (or maybe I'm just using an old version), but on the whole, it's a useful road map.<br>
                                            8) Download <a href=http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=11824 target="dltcep">DLTCEP</a>. This is <u>the</u> tool that I've found to be most useful in my own modding work (which I admit is negligible). Whenever I want to make a
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp creature, item, spell, etc., DLTCEP is my toolbox and workbench. It, like, rules, and stuff.<br>
                                            <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><a href=images/nearinfinity.jpg><img src=images/tnearinfinity.jpg alt="Hendak! You ignorant, barbaric slave! What's the hex offset I need to move to in order to patch your EA status?"></a><td width=10><td>
                                            9) Download <a href=http://infexp.sourceforge.net/ target="infexp">Infinity Explorer</a>. This is a read-only tool that opens up the libraries of any Infinity Engine game (read: BG1 &
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp BG2) so you can poke around and examine the specifics of creatures, items, etc., including some things that DLTCEP
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp doesn't do: You can view animation sequences, scrutinize map areas and their associated containers & triggers, run through
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *.BAM files quickly, and more. Good stuff.<br>
                                            10) Download <a href=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~joh/ni/ target="ni">Near Infinity</a>. For the most part, this program is similar to Infinity Explorer, but it's read/write, and instead of
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pretty graphics, you get closer to the nitty-gritty of the actual datafiles. More powerful, but less user-friendly, I haven't had
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp cause to use it much . . . but when I did, it was the only tool that could do the job. Be prepared to learn about bitwise
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp operations and hex offsets if you enter here.</table>
                                            11) <a href=http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showtopic=113&st=0 target="prefix">Register a prefix</a> for your files. This is the first 2 characters of every file you create, so that different mods don't overwrite each other. For instance, if "Joey
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kimball" and a guy with the username "JanoKarnian" both use the prefix "JK," and both write mods that include a spell file named JKSP118.SPL, the
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp second file with that name <u>will</u> replace the first one, which can cause all sorts of nasty bugs. So before you start actually making files, register a unique prefix.
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Note: Your prefix cannot begin with a number.)<br>
                                            12) Modding is <b>not</b> easy. You will have trouble, you will get stuck, you will be tripped up by things that you didn't expect. A lot of your successes will come
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp through pure trial & error. If you're not getting anywhere, ask for help on the forums—but don't be too quick to do so, put at least <u>some</u> effort into solving
                                            <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp your difficulties for yourself, as even your mistakes will teach you something.<br>
                                            13) Don't ask me for modding help, or even advice. I am not an experienced modder, and most of what advice I have to give is summed up in this list.<br><br>

                                                you), it would certainly be known (or at least available) to your party members, if not your own character. This stuff is common knowledge throughout the Realms, and is presented here to help make your trip
                                                through the game a more fulfilling one, and give you a general idea of the world that the game characters inhabit. It is not meant to be an <i>exhaustive</i> compendium of canon lore—there are enough such
                                                sites already, and I'd be a fool to try to compete with anything like the Forgotten Realms Wiki. If you're hungry for more specifics, I suggest visiting the related links in Appendix C, and of course

                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The world of Abeir-Toril is, unsurprisingly, very similar to Earth. At least among Faerunian cultures, the day is divided into twenty-four hours, with each new "day" counted as starting at midnight. Their single moon orbits the planet every twenty-eight days, with a cycle of lunar phases that mirrors ours exactly. The solar year is exactly 365.25 days long, divided into twelve months of 30 days each, with five additional festival days that fall between certain months.
                                                Every 4th year, the extra day of Shieldmeet is added, to keep the calendar in line with the planet's revolutions. Months are commonly broken up into 3 "tendays" of, naturally, 10 days<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td>
                                                each, although some cultures find the seven-day "week" a more convenient frame of reference. Their annual calendar, like ours, does not place the beginning of a new year on the Winter Solstice, but rather a few days afterward. This total arrangement of days and months in relation to natural cycles was first codified by
                                                the wizard Harptos, so long ago that his name is almost completely forgotten.<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In everyday life, years are most frequently expressed in reference to the establishment of the current system of government of the local kingdom or city-state. Historical records, however, tend to be able to look beyond immediate powers, and seek to establish a more consistent standard. At the time at which the Baldur's Gate games take place, there are four major systems in relatively common use, each with its merits and proponents:<br>
                                                <b>Cormyr Reckoning (CR)</b> dates from the founding of House Obarskyr, the dynasty that still rules that land. Cormyr is a powerful nation heavily populated with Humans, who keep historical records in Common and travel far and wide, but unfortunately some early records taken in Cormyr Reckoning are somewhat distorted, possibly in an attempt to bring the whole system into lockstep with the slighty-older Dalereckoning.<br>
                                                <b>Dalereckoning (DR)</b> counts Year 0 as the raising of the Standing Stone, commemorating the treaty beween the Human Dalefolk and the Elves of Cormanthor. This is the system most commonly used, at least by those sages whose works are presented to us. One of its strong points is that it was the form of timekeeping familar to the prophet Alaundo, so that no matter what systems are used to document the past and present, glimmers of the future are attached to numbers in Dalereckoning.<br>
                                                The <b>Mulhorand Calendar (MC)</b> has the claim of being the oldest calendar still in current use. It dates from the establishment of the Mulhorandi city of Skuld, the most ancient human settlement that is still extant today.<br>
                                                <b>Present Reckoning (PR)</b> was established as a way to shrug off the various disagreeing numerologies and their basis on long-past events of a mostly local importance.

Legend says that Alaundo saw a vision of his own impending death, so he journeyed to Candlekeep to donate his records for posterity, arriving in 75 DR.
                                                He died there, almost unmourned, of a plague the next year. The sages at the library were so amazed by the accuracy of the predictions that starting in 82 DR, the monks there began a never-ending "Chant of the Unfulfilled Prophecies" which has continued uninterrupted to this day. All of Alaundo's books have been committed to memory by the thirty monks devoted to the task. As a prophecy comes to pass, the monks remove it from their chant. <i>[Editor's Note: This document and the Baldur's Gate games
                                                are not in direct agreement. In BG1, set in DR 1368, at least three of the monks chant prophecies that had come true years before.]</i><br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alaundo used the Roll of Years in labeling his prophecies. There are a number of sages who believe that Alaundo created the Roll of Years, but this is largely wrong. The Roll of Years was started back in -422 DR by a sage named Augathra the Mad. Augathra was an elderly woman who began to have visions, which she recorded. The majority of these were lost over time, and those that remained have not always proven accurate. The Roll of Years extends to what will be 2163 DR,
                                                and has remained largely intact. One or two smaller sections of the Roll are missing, lost to time, and these Alaundo had replaced with names of his own devising. The biggest gaps are from 1352 to 1369 DR and from 1804 to 1829 DR, though there are about a dozen one- or two-year gaps throughout. It is said that Alaundo catered his prophecies to Augathra's names, as the old woman did not have a very good track record with her own prophecies.<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first volume of Alaundo's Portents includes a short introduction in which the seer records his intents. This takes the form of about two pages of acknowledgments, a sizable (10 page) prayer to Savras, and a discussion of the immutable nature of history and self-fulfilling prophecies. The somewhat purple conclusion of the introduction remains most telling of Alaundo's intentions:<blockquote>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "...[S]o if nothing else may be gleaned from my words, my visions, my hopes and fears, then I wish that my reader may know this: All of the world is a living organism, heartier than a Worldthrone dwarf. Though its face may be scarred from age to age by war, disease, or strife, though dragons may swoop from the skies to erase the most ancient of kingdoms without a trace, though powers omnipotent today will be forgotten tomorrow, the heart of the world shall continue to
                                                beat. Dust settles, babies continue to be born, and songbirds herald each new day. Knowledge of the future is no key to happiness, nor should it allow complacency, only solace and truth. No matter how terrible the tragedy, until a future day far yet to come, there will always be a tomorrow. In the marching of time, there exists a definite rhythm, and knowledge of the rhythm allows a person with foresight to plan best for their future without the folly of blindness.<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These things also I have observed: that knowledge of our world is to be nurtured like a precious flower, for it is the most precious thing we have. Wherefore guard the word written and heed the word unwritten - and set them down ere they fade like so many sublime rainbows after Kozah's fury has abated, or a beautiful dream in the morning hours. Learn then, well, the arts of reading, writing, and listening true, and they will lead you to the greatest art of all:
                                                Understanding.<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This said, know ye reader now this: These words are the words of Lord Savras, revealed to me in his infinite wisdom so that I may guide the hands and hearts of those discerning enough to use these words well. May you find comfort in the truth, dear reader."</blockquote>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alaundo's writing style may leave something to be desired, but his prophecies are as of yet unerring. For the uninitiated, it should be known that there are three types of prophecies: the laconic, the detailed, and the conditional. Examples of each follow.<br><br>
                                                Laconic:<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <i>"White birds shall vanish from the North, and great evil shall die and be reborn."</i> —Sixth Portents<br>
                                                Common interpretation: This passage is commonly thought to be Alaundo's only reference to the Time of Troubles for two reasons. The passage appears under the heading of the Year of Shadows, a complicated year on which Alaundo barely comments. Also, Alaundo enjoys using birds as a symbol for deities and other immortal creatures, and several allusions were made in prior volumes to Mystra as a dove.<br><br>
                                                Detailed:<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <i>"Twelve days 'fore Greengrass, his last rally mounts/<br>Azzer-ash shall leave his men but for one/<br>To him, he will name barons and viscounts/<br>And there disclose his dream to the iron son.<br>His vision entails his own demise/<br>Unheralded beneath the north sea wave/<br>He'll ask his memory be kept alive/<br>His name invoked in war and peace to save.<br>Two days hence, the dragons shall roar its last/<br>The proud king's body shall never be found/<br>
                                                His solidiers will keep his memory fast/<br>His kingdom shall become his sacred ground.<br>The eternal king nigh thirteen score year/<br>Inclement tyrant and holy savior."</i> —Fifth Portents<br>
                                                Common interpretation: In 1018 DR, the great general Tchazzer of Chessenta was lost in a lone battle against the Sahuagin, his body never to be recovered. After his death, his name became invoked by local warriors who honor his memory or do well in battle themselves. Within ten years, an organized church of Tchazzer arose, with a priesthood capable of casting some basic spells. As is always the case when specific individuals are involved, the name is obscured somehow or a nickname used. Tchazzer is
                                                a phonetical anagram of Azzar-ash, and the "iron son" referred to is literally Imperator Aeruthax, the Iron Fist, Son of Ranais, who records show was Tchazzer's choice to rule in his place, but was unable to gain control of the nation except by force.<br><br>
                                                Conditional:<br>
                                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <i>"When Nightal is almost at a close/<br>There from the gate wall shall descend/<br>A serpent to blow the Horn of Doom/<br>At the graveyard Kingdom of Man.<br>If the Star of Storms is its brightest/<br>When the dulcet ballad is played/<br>Soundest ground shall be torn asunder/<br>The tapestry forever frayed.<br>But if the Raging King has failed/<br>To keep his five retainers true/<br>Come 'morrow, the blessed sun will rise/<br>
                                                And no chaos shall ill ensue."</i> —Ninth Portents<br>
                                                Common interpretation: This is one of Alaundo's most famous prophecies, as it is the last one to appear in "Ninth Portents." The date is not given, but scholars suggest that it refers to 2163 DR, the Year of the Saddened Magicians, the last year recorded in the Roll of Years. The prophecy is so famous that a number of common people in larger cities may recognize it, and the "Horn of Doom" is an expression used throughout the Moonsea region for any loud noise that causes a fright.
                                                The meaning of the word "serpent" is ambiguous at best: claims range from dragons to yuan-ti to human rouges with serpentine names. The "wall" is most likely the Spine of the World, or the North Wall in some older texts. The Kingdom of Man was an actual empire of little consequence which lasted about forty-five years, but because the actual name appears, there is a good chance the quatrains refer to some largely human kingdom, possibly Cormyr. The Star of Storms has two meanings; Uthgardt
                                                barbarians refer to the Aurora Borealis by such a colloquial term, but it is far more likely to refer to Talos, the Stormstar, as Alaundo uses the name in other prophecies. The tapestry is thought to refer to the magical Weave, though it appears to be unique to this prediction as a metaphor for magical energy. Most interesting to some, perhaps, is the King and the five retainers. The king may likely be another reference to Talos, and it is thought that the five troops may be five servitor gods. As
                                                Talos is one of the most prolific (as well as oldest) of the gods as far as promoting mortals to such divine status, there is a certain cause for alarm to be taken from the passage. Currently it is believed that Talos does have five gods in his service, but certain sages knowledgeable about such things tend to discount Malyk for varying reasons.<br><br>
